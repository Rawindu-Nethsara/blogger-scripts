WEBVTT

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.459
The forests of Pandora...

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.711
hold many dangers.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.886
But the most dangerous thing...

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:35.804
about Pandora...

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.894
is that you may grow
to love her too much.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.867
We sing the songcords to remember.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.911
Each bead...

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.579
a story
in our life.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:05.750
A bead for the
birth of our son.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.881
Neteyam!

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:13.842
Neteyam!

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:21.808
A bead...

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.144
when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.272
Born of Grace's avatar.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.734
A daughter whose
conception was a total mystery.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:46.249
A bead...

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:47.709
for the first
communion with Eywa.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.214
The People say...

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.174
we live
in Eywa...

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.969
and Eywa
lives in us.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.349
The Great Mother...

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.767
holds all her children...

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:04.643
in her heart.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.028
Happiness is simple.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.616
But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code?

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.628
Before I knew it,
we had four.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.051
When we sent the Sky
People back to Earth...

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.678
a few of 'em stayed.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.222
Science guys,
loyal to the Na'vi.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.308
And then
there was Spider.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.310
He was just stuck here.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.062
Too young
for a cryo-capsule.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.897
You little wild man.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:51.648
See you, Norm!

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:52.524
Orphaned by the war...

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.150
he was raised
by the lab guys.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:54.943
Spider, take
your spare!

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.486
I'm just going
to the village!

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.614
He wasn't
part of our family.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.032
He was like a stray cat.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.200
Just always around.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.704
Inseparable from our kids.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:10.834
To Neytiri...

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.294
he would
always be alien.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.170
One of them.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.351
{\an8}Took a few years to get the
language through my thick skull.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.520
{\an8}But now
when I hear it...

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.646
{\an8}it might as well be English.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.106
{\an8}I hate you!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.484
Well, I hate you
times infinity, Lo'ak!

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:37.736
Penis face!

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.738
Hey! Hey!
That's enough.

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:41.906
Don't make me
come over there.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.451
He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:45.869
There he is.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:49.873
There you go.
Go get it!

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:50.624
Yeah!

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.002
Hey, Neteyam,
the mighty fisherman.

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.503
There you go. Good boy.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.092
Wow, that's a big one.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.260
By the rocks.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.596
Right where
you said.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.431
How tall is he?

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.433
- He's... that tall.
- He's tall!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.809
Goes by
too fast.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.478
Like a dream.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.481
- Kiri.
- Bro, come on.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:15.649
Come on.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.734
Smile, skxawng.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.153
Happiness is simple.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:24.616
Like date night.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.493
Time away from the kids.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.068
But the thing
about happiness...

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.863
it can vanish
in a heartbeat.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.247
A new star in the night.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.458
It could only mean one thing.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.218
Ships. Decelerating.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.854
And Sky
People returning.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.797
Pulse 168.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.007
Yeah, here it comes.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.175
You're just fine.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.801
Just lie still.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.303
Stay calm.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.515
Yep. Pupillary
reflex is good.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:18.808
Get that out of his face.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.018
Colonel...

00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:21.645
can you hear me?

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:22.687
Colonel?

00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:27.275
You need to lie
back down, sir.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:33.865
Sedate him!
Sedate him!

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:34.991
Get outta here.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.242
Go, go, go!

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.202
Get security!

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.370
- Grab him!
- Grab him!

00:09:39.663 --> 00:09:40.580
Hold him!

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:41.331
Calm down!

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.499
Colonel,
stand down!

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:43.458
Colonel...

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.209
it's me!

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.585
Corporal Wainfleet!

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.548
Lyle?

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.134
That you?

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:56.054
Yes, sir.
And Z Dog.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:58.390
And Fike.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.061
I'm all right.
Let me go.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:04.854
I'm all right.

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.252
Well...

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.380
ain't this a bitch.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:43.852
Stand by. Two minutes to
Pandora insertion. Secure for Delta V.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.272
All right. Umbilical's clear.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.691
Pulse ox 89.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:54.904
In case you haven't figured it
out yet, you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.699
Only younger,
taller, bluer...

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.409
and not nearly
as good-lookin'.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.162
In two hours,
I fly a mission...

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.039
against the
Na'vi's stronghold.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:08.960
The powers that be thought it prudent
that I do this backup just in case.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.296
And if you are
watchin' it, well...

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.548
it means that I did
get my ticket punched.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.760
Hey, Parker...

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.929
just what the hell am I
supposed to say now?

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:20.931
Just remind him
how this works.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:22.891
Here.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.977
So see this? This is all your
memories and your personality.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.437
We're gonna send
this back to Earth...

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.940
where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.691
We're gonna imprint
you with it, and then...

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:32.442
Hey, hey, hey.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.194
Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.278
Hurry it up.
Hurry it up.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.280
Anyway,
the idea...

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:41.201
is to get the minds of the
saltiest on-world operators.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.579
Yeah, like Corporal
Wainfleet over there...

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.415
and your humble
narrator into...

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.125
recombinant bodies.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.419
You're a
recom now, Colonel...

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.964
loaded with my
memories and my charm.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.883
What you won't
remember is my death...

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.385
because it
hasn't happened yet...

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.095
and it ain't gonna.

00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:01.680
- Damn right.
- Hell yeah.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.390
Well, whatever happened...

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:07.644
if you're any clone of mine, you'll
be lookin' for some payback.

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.105
And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:14.943
Remember, kid...

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:17.153
a Marine
can't be defeated.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.072
Oh, you can kill us...

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.616
but we'll just
regroup in hell.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.077
Semper fi.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.065
Ground team, go!

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.287
Take this! Go!

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.710
Let's go. Two
minutes, people. Let's go.

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:01.967
Bro, we have got
to get down there.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.177
No way!
Dad will skin us!

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.096
Come on.
Don't be a wuss.

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:07.514
Lo'ak!

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.099
Get back
here, you...

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:13.395
Taking the
whole case!

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.105
We're taking mags,
the RPGs, the stingers.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.735
Bro, let's go. Come on!

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:21.945
Okay, let's go!

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.031
Move! Take that!

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:26.658
Take these weapons.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:27.409
Here, boy. Go!

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.204
You don't even
know how to use it.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:33.999
Dad taught me.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:42.841
Gunship's
inbound!

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:51.808
Bro, come on!

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:03.320
Lo'ak, where are you?

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.195
Neteyam!

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.823
Easy, easy, you okay?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.575
- Yeah.
- Where's your brother?

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:10.410
- That way.
- Where is he? Where?

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:11.328
Get outta here!

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.078
Go on!

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:14.289
Neteyam!

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:17.834
Oh, no.

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:21.546
Oh, no, no, no.

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.298
Oh, God.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:29.554
Dad?

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.559
What are you doin' here, boy?
What the hell were you thinkin'?

00:15:35.644 --> 00:15:36.645
I'm sorry.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.522
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.946
We are not in Kansas anymore.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.782
We are going to Pandora.

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.076
Now...

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.038
I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.167
Why so blue?

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.090
For our sins
in our past life...

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.132
we have been
brought back...

00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:08.551
in the form
of our enemy.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:12.639
That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.058
And with
our training...

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.977
that's a pretty
potent mix.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.063
Do we have a
mission yet?

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.439
Indeed
we do.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.901
Our mission is to
hunt down and kill...

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:26.987
the leader of the
Na'vi insurgency.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.991
The one they call
Toruk Makto.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:32.909
Jake Sully.

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:34.035
Yeah!

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.295
Attack, attack!

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.463
Got ya!

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.381
Tuk!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.132
Come on!

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:49.134
I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:50.302
Skxawng.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.469
No, seriously.

00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:52.679
And the animals
respect me more.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.347
They don't think
of me as human.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.224
Wait.
You're human?

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:07.402
They're
coming!

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:13.658
They're coming!

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:14.784
Kiri, Spider!

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:16.827
The war party's
coming back!

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.246
Come on,
come on.

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:19.788
Let's go,
come on.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.472
- Mom!
- Tuk...

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:37.182
- Mom.
- Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:40.268
Fall in.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.564
You're supposed
to be spotters.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.399
You spot bogeys,
and you call 'em in.

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:47.609
From a
distance!

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.861
Does any of this
sound familiar? Get here!

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.447
Jesus. I let you two
geniuses fly a mission...

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.282
and you disobey
direct orders.

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:57.619
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded? Please?

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:58.787
My brother
is wounded.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:17:59.955
It's fine.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:01.790
- Tuk, go with her. Go.
- Dad.

00:18:01.957 --> 00:18:03.875
Sir. I take
full responsibility.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:04.709
Yeah, you do.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:05.543
That's right.

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.421
'Cause you're the older
brother. You gotta act like it.

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.632
MaJake.

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:12.926
Your son is
actually bleeding.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.511
Mother,
it's fine. I...

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.598
Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:27.232
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:28.817
Yes, sir.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.696
You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.240
Now, see to the ikran.
All of 'em.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:36.283
Yes, sir.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:37.993
And get that
crap off your face.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.920
Aw, want a kiss
on the boo-boo?

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:50.088
- Give him this.
- Okay.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:51.798
I would use yalna bark.

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:52.591
Here, drink.

00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:53.341
Oh, you would?

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.218
And who
is Tsahik?

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:56.928
You are, Grand... Move!

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.764
You are, Grandmother.
But yalna bark is better.

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.393
It stings less.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:05.312
Mighty Warrior.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.279
What?

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.950
Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:21.995
It is very
hard on them.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:24.914
I know.

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.252
You are very
hard on them.

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.840
I'm their father.
It's my job.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.469
This is
not a squad.

00:19:37.636 --> 00:19:39.137
It is a family.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.900
I thought
we'd lost them.

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:01.868
Hey, man.
How's it going?

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:02.869
Hey, Spider.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:04.788
Your ass
is mine.

00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:05.872
I'm right here.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:07.791
Avatars only...

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:08.583
go around!

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:10.168
Sorry.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.921
Yeah. Those blue stripes
don't make you any bigger, bro.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.215
Yeah, well, I can
still kick your ass.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:19.719
Hell of a day.

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:20.887
Long run.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.433
Real hysterical, guys.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.018
You know what
really sucks though?

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.311
Is you can breathe
Earth air for hours...

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:31.064
and I can only breathe
your air for, like, 10 seconds.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.608
Yeah, Monkey Boy,
that really sucks.

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:34.776
For you.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.326
- Hi, Max.
- Hey, kids.

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:44.160
Hey. What's up, Max?

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:45.537
What's up, Norm?

00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:52.460
Hi, Ma.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.765
Maybe I'm just losing it out here...

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:07.684
but I'm seeing real evidence...

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:11.563
of a systemic response on a global level.

00:21:12.314 --> 00:21:13.398
I can't...

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.611
I won't use the term
"intelligence." It's...

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.780
maybe "awareness"
is a better word.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:25.619
It's like the entire
biosphere of Pandora...

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:27.120
is aware...

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:30.373
and capable of this
cognitive response.

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.460
Oh, crap,
I can't say that.

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.462
They'll
crucify me.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:37.088
I mean,
I need to say...

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:39.966
So who do you think
knocked her up?

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:41.968
Pretty sure it was Norm.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.136
Totally.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.598
You do not
deserve to live.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.099
No, no, no.
Think about it, right?

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:49.559
I mean, he's the
teacher's pet.

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.186
He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:53.271
I would
kill myself.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:54.773
I would
drink acid.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.900
Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:59.319
Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:00.487
Hey.

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:02.697
See, I'm thinkin'...

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:05.575
their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:06.993
Gross!

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.911
Guys.

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:10.789
I mean, sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:16.503
Whatever.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.421
Don't even
remember him.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:19.839
No, Spider.

00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.800
- Dude.
- Spider...

00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:25.637
You are not him.

00:23:06.303 --> 00:23:08.847
Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.

00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:10.056
Do not stop.

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:15.687
Masks off.

00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:21.526
Sir...

00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:23.028
this is
the General.

00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:34.289
General
Ardmore.

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:36.666
Good to meet you, Colonel.

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:38.668
I've heard good things...

00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:41.463
but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:42.505
Walk with me.

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:47.677
The new ops
center is over here.

00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:49.012
That just came online.

00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:52.807
These Swarm Assemblers,
they can put up a building in six days.

00:23:53.934 --> 00:23:57.604
We have done more here in a year
than in the previous 30 years.

00:23:59.272 --> 00:24:01.191
We're not here to
run a mine, Colonel.

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:02.859
As On-World
Commander...

00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:04.778
I have been charged
with a greater mission.

00:24:10.283 --> 00:24:11.368
Earth
is dying.

00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:15.872
Our task here is to
tame this frontier.

00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:18.750
Nothing less than
to make Pandora...

00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.126
the new home
for humanity.

00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:23.755
But before
we can do that...

00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:26.174
we need to
pacify the hostiles.

00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:32.097
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:34.641
His strikes are well-planned.

00:24:34.808 --> 00:24:37.477
He's got tight coordination
between his ground and air assets.

00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:42.357
His forces are hitting our
outlying sites. The mines, pipelines...

00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:44.150
cutting off our supply chain.

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.903
And they hit a maglev two days ago.

00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:53.451
Any intel on Sully's...

00:24:53.576 --> 00:24:54.703
base of operations?

00:24:54.869 --> 00:24:56.121
Yeah.
Give me the mountains.

00:24:58.081 --> 00:25:01.042
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

00:25:03.253 --> 00:25:06.214
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:10.385
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:13.430
We only get 10 minutes
in enemy airspace...

00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:14.973
they are all over us.

00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:19.060
Colonel...

00:25:19.227 --> 00:25:22.188
we believe your Blue Team will
be perceived as indigenous...

00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:24.024
and will not trigger...

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.941
the immune response.

00:25:25.108 --> 00:25:27.944
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

00:25:28.987 --> 00:25:30.071
The hard way.

00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:33.074
Outstanding.

00:25:46.838 --> 00:25:48.465
We're entering
hostile airspace.

00:25:49.215 --> 00:25:50.258
Copy that.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.270
- Bro!
- Go, Monkey Boy!

00:26:02.437 --> 00:26:04.606
Guys, wait up!

00:26:41.393 --> 00:26:42.978
Tuk!
Keep up!

00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:44.980
Okay, okay.

00:26:45.146 --> 00:26:46.481
Bro, why'd you
bring her anyway?

00:26:47.107 --> 00:26:48.191
She's such
a cry baby.

00:26:48.733 --> 00:26:50.819
She's all,
"I'm telling.

00:26:50.944 --> 00:26:51.736
"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield.

00:26:51.903 --> 00:26:53.738
"I'll tell Mom if you
don't let me come."

00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:55.073
Don't pick on her.

00:26:57.075 --> 00:26:58.076
Come on.

00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:00.704
Oh, sick!

00:27:01.997 --> 00:27:03.373
Are there any
dead bodies up there?

00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:05.292
Bro, check it out.
Come on.

00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:50.712
No shit.

00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:02.599
Kiri.

00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:04.017
Kiri.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.021
Kiri...

00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:09.522
Kiri, hey.

00:28:09.689 --> 00:28:10.690
Hey.

00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:16.780
Are you okay?

00:28:17.864 --> 00:28:20.116
I was doing that
thing again, wasn't I?

00:28:20.533 --> 00:28:22.327
Yeah, you were.

00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:24.162
Kiri!

00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:26.373
- Kiri!
- Kiri, we have to get back.

00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:27.540
All right,
come on.

00:28:32.837 --> 00:28:33.964
What is it?

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:36.967
We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:41.554
It's way too
big for a human.

00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:43.098
- Avatars?
- Maybe...

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.017
but they're for
sure not ours.

00:28:47.769 --> 00:28:48.770
What are you doing?

00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:50.230
I'm tracking.

00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:10.500
Watch your six.

00:29:13.587 --> 00:29:14.629
Clear.

00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:19.759
Perimeter
up.

00:29:33.064 --> 00:29:34.065
Damn.

00:29:56.588 --> 00:29:58.298
We are never supposed to come here.

00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:01.217
Dad is going
to ground you.

00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:02.594
Can you stop?

00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:03.511
For life.

00:30:04.596 --> 00:30:05.931
Bro, we have got to
check this out.

00:30:06.264 --> 00:30:07.057
Let's go.

00:30:24.658 --> 00:30:25.659
Bro...

00:30:26.242 --> 00:30:27.702
that's where your dad and my dad...

00:30:28.578 --> 00:30:29.579
fought.

00:30:30.038 --> 00:30:31.790
That's your
dad's actual suit.

00:30:32.582 --> 00:30:34.000
Holy shit.

00:30:35.252 --> 00:30:36.670
Lyle,
see if you can...

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.755
pull some data
off that dash cam.

00:30:39.756 --> 00:30:41.716
That thing's deader
than shit, Colonel.

00:30:41.883 --> 00:30:42.676
So were we.

00:30:42.801 --> 00:30:43.426
All right.

00:30:44.469 --> 00:30:45.470
I gotta call
this in.

00:30:45.637 --> 00:30:47.055
No, bro, we're gonna
get in trouble.

00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:48.223
Let's go.

00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:55.355
Devil Dog, Devil Dog,
this is Eagle Eye, over.

00:30:55.855 --> 00:30:57.607
Eagle Eye.
Send your traffic.

00:30:57.774 --> 00:30:59.067
I got eyes
on some guys.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:02.904
They look
like avatars...

00:31:03.113 --> 00:31:05.198
but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.

00:31:05.949 --> 00:31:08.243
There's six of them. Over.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:09.661
What's your pos?
Over.

00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:13.248
We're at
the old shack.

00:31:16.418 --> 00:31:17.419
Who's "we"?

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.380
Me, Spider, Kiri...

00:31:22.173 --> 00:31:23.174
and Tuk.

00:31:28.763 --> 00:31:30.599
Son, you listen to
me very carefully.

00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:31.766
You pull back
right now.

00:31:31.891 --> 00:31:32.809
Do not
make a sound.

00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:34.227
You get the
hell out of there.

00:31:34.352 --> 00:31:35.145
Move! You copy?

00:31:35.562 --> 00:31:36.563
Yes, sir,
moving out.

00:31:36.688 --> 00:31:37.314
See,
I told you!

00:31:37.314 --> 00:31:38.023
Go, go.

00:31:38.898 --> 00:31:39.899
Dad...

00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:41.443
I know
a quick way!

00:31:47.073 --> 00:31:48.658
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

00:31:49.117 --> 00:31:50.118
Kiri, stop.

00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:51.411
Guys,
come on.

00:31:51.578 --> 00:31:52.621
It's almost eclipse,
come on.

00:31:55.582 --> 00:31:56.583
Put it down!
Down!

00:31:57.417 --> 00:31:58.418
Put it down or
I'll shoot you!

00:31:58.585 --> 00:31:59.502
With me.

00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:00.295
Drop it!

00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:01.004
Right now!

00:32:02.589 --> 00:32:04.466
{\an8}Do not move!
Put your hands up!

00:32:04.925 --> 00:32:05.926
Spider.

00:32:06.468 --> 00:32:08.136
Get 'em!
Get 'em!

00:32:08.303 --> 00:32:09.679
Get over here! Come on!

00:32:10.263 --> 00:32:11.389
Get down!

00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:13.099
Stop fighting.

00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:14.809
Don't move!

00:32:14.976 --> 00:32:15.977
Check 'em
for weapons!

00:32:16.603 --> 00:32:17.604
Kiri!

00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:21.358
Shut up.

00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:22.067
Don't move.

00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:24.152
What have we here?

00:32:34.204 --> 00:32:35.080
Hey, Colonel...

00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:35.997
check it out.

00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:37.540
Four fingers.

00:32:38.083 --> 00:32:39.209
We got a half-breed.

00:32:39.584 --> 00:32:40.585
Shit...

00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:48.426
Show me
your fingers.

00:32:53.932 --> 00:32:56.518
You're his,
aren't you?

00:32:58.645 --> 00:32:59.980
You're his,
all right.

00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:07.862
Where is he?

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.041
No!

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:22.836
Really?

00:33:22.836 --> 00:33:24.379
You wanna play
it this way?

00:33:26.298 --> 00:33:26.923
Shut up!

00:33:30.802 --> 00:33:31.553
Kiri!

00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:32.429
No!
Stop!

00:33:32.971 --> 00:33:34.306
Hey! Hey,
don't touch her!

00:33:35.307 --> 00:33:36.016
Hey!

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:37.892
Don't hurt
her, please.

00:33:40.145 --> 00:33:41.354
Don't move.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.356
What's your
name, kid?

00:33:45.317 --> 00:33:46.484
Spider...

00:33:47.235 --> 00:33:48.111
Socorro.

00:33:57.287 --> 00:33:58.288
Miles?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.501
Nobody calls me that.

00:34:06.338 --> 00:34:07.756
Well,
I'll be damned...

00:34:09.299 --> 00:34:11.843
Well, I figured they
sent you back to Earth.

00:34:13.094 --> 00:34:15.137
They can't put
babies in cryo, dipshit.

00:34:22.561 --> 00:34:24.146
What are we
doin', boss?

00:34:26.608 --> 00:34:28.360
Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

00:34:33.197 --> 00:34:34.574
Blue One, Iron Sky,
send your traffic.

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.242
We are standing by
for extract, over.

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:39.119
Take us in.

00:34:39.287 --> 00:34:40.121
Dragonfly
comin' left...

00:34:40.246 --> 00:34:41.664
we are go for extract.

00:34:42.164 --> 00:34:43.166
Be advised...

00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:44.709
we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

00:34:44.876 --> 00:34:45.876
Let us go!

00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:46.586
Shut up.

00:34:46.586 --> 00:34:47.796
Sit tight, Blue One...

00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:48.755
we're inbound
to your pos.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.715
That's bingo in ten.

00:34:50.882 --> 00:34:51.925
We're on the clock.

00:34:54.594 --> 00:34:56.054
- Sit!
- Come on, in the dirt!

00:34:56.221 --> 00:34:57.305
- Feet up!
- Get down on the ground!

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.056
Lyle...

00:34:58.056 --> 00:34:59.307
get me some
audio on this.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.559
Shut your mouth.

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:02.310
Don't look up!

00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:04.187
That's
Sully's woman.

00:35:05.855 --> 00:35:06.982
She's an animal.

00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:09.150
Give it up, Quaritch.

00:35:10.402 --> 00:35:11.403
Sully.

00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:12.988
- It's all over.
- Son of a bitch.

00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:16.032
Nothin's over
while I'm breathin'.

00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:18.910
I kinda hoped you'd say that.

00:35:36.219 --> 00:35:37.429
No, no, you stay
with the ikran.

00:35:37.596 --> 00:35:38.680
But, Dad...

00:35:38.805 --> 00:35:39.514
I'm a warrior
like you.

00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:40.265
I'm supposed
to fight.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.182
Neteyam.

00:35:41.308 --> 00:35:43.101
I'm not gonna
say it again.

00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:45.812
Yes, sir.

00:36:08.627 --> 00:36:10.045
Yeah, there's
nothin' after that.

00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:25.769
You want us to recover these remains?

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.922
Blue One, stand by ready.

00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:55.006
We are three
minutes out.

00:36:55.173 --> 00:36:56.967
Heads up,
three minutes.

00:37:12.565 --> 00:37:13.566
Watch our six.

00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:03.700
Shut up!

00:38:18.798 --> 00:38:19.507
Shut up!

00:38:21.426 --> 00:38:22.594
Contact rear!

00:38:22.928 --> 00:38:23.762
Contact rear!

00:38:27.265 --> 00:38:28.266
Lo'ak!

00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:30.101
Shit.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.105
You little shit.

00:38:34.105 --> 00:38:34.814
Lo'ak!

00:38:34.814 --> 00:38:36.316
- Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
- Get back here!

00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:37.484
Run!

00:38:38.068 --> 00:38:38.902
Grab 'em!

00:38:45.867 --> 00:38:46.868
Come on!

00:38:47.911 --> 00:38:48.912
Cover!

00:38:52.749 --> 00:38:53.750
Come on!

00:39:08.932 --> 00:39:10.558
That you,
Mrs. Sully?

00:39:11.226 --> 00:39:13.228
I recognize your calling card.

00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:25.824
Why don't you come
on out, Mrs. Sully?

00:39:27.534 --> 00:39:28.743
You and I,
we got some...

00:39:29.286 --> 00:39:30.912
unfinished business.

00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:36.459
Demon!

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.588
I will kill you as many
times as I have to!

00:39:40.714 --> 00:39:43.425
I guess you and the Corporal
have been pretty...

00:39:43.633 --> 00:39:45.176
busy, haven't you?

00:39:45.343 --> 00:39:47.262
Dropped yourself a whole litter of...

00:39:48.096 --> 00:39:49.139
half-breeds.

00:39:58.064 --> 00:39:58.773
Na'vi!

00:40:02.068 --> 00:40:03.069
Go, go, go!

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.406
You okay?
You okay, boy?

00:40:06.406 --> 00:40:07.157
Yeah.

00:40:07.616 --> 00:40:09.200
Okay. With me.
Ready? Ready?

00:40:09.326 --> 00:40:09.993
Yes, sir!

00:40:12.329 --> 00:40:13.330
Move!

00:40:17.959 --> 00:40:18.960
Come on!

00:40:27.677 --> 00:40:28.678
Go, go, go!

00:40:29.554 --> 00:40:30.805
Flank out. Get after 'em!

00:40:38.063 --> 00:40:39.064
Spider?

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.485
Spider!

00:40:43.652 --> 00:40:44.402
Kiri!

00:40:44.527 --> 00:40:45.153
Spider.

00:40:45.695 --> 00:40:47.364
Come! Come on.

00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:49.699
Spider. He's
down there.

00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:50.450
No.

00:40:55.622 --> 00:40:56.831
Ma'am,
we're at bingo.

00:40:56.998 --> 00:40:58.458
Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

00:40:59.584 --> 00:41:01.086
Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

00:41:08.718 --> 00:41:09.344
Blue One...

00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:10.095
fall back.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.471
Fall back!

00:41:11.638 --> 00:41:12.847
Fall back, fall back!

00:41:13.139 --> 00:41:14.140
Move out! Move!

00:41:15.016 --> 00:41:15.976
Move, move, move!

00:41:16.977 --> 00:41:17.852
- Kiri!
- Spider!

00:41:17.978 --> 00:41:19.145
Come, come.

00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:19.896
No.

00:41:19.896 --> 00:41:20.605
Come!

00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:21.773
Go, go, go.
Come on. Let's go.

00:41:24.567 --> 00:41:26.069
Hey. Hey, it's
okay. You hurt?

00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:27.195
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm okay.

00:41:27.362 --> 00:41:28.530
- Tuk, you hurt?
- Daddy!

00:41:48.717 --> 00:41:49.801
Okay,
we're clear.

00:41:49.968 --> 00:41:51.011
We're clear.
Everyone okay?

00:41:51.011 --> 00:41:52.470
- Mom!
- Tuk.

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:57.892
It's okay. It's
okay. We're okay.

00:41:58.184 --> 00:42:00.061
Oh, thank you, Great
Mother. Thank you.

00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:01.938
Thank you.

00:42:02.564 --> 00:42:03.565
Where's Spider?

00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:05.900
They took him.

00:42:06.985 --> 00:42:07.986
They took him.

00:42:09.195 --> 00:42:10.530
Okay. It's all
right, baby girl.

00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:11.698
All right? He's
a tough kid.

00:42:12.574 --> 00:42:13.617
All right.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.661
He's gonna be okay.

00:42:18.496 --> 00:42:19.789
We're all gonna be okay.

00:42:29.799 --> 00:42:30.717
Goddamn!

00:42:30.842 --> 00:42:31.509
Come on!

00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:37.557
Let me out
of here!

00:42:45.982 --> 00:42:47.108
He's completely feral.

00:42:48.026 --> 00:42:49.069
Thinks he's
one of them.

00:42:53.406 --> 00:42:54.658
This thing.
This Quaritch.

00:42:54.824 --> 00:42:55.867
Whatever he is...

00:42:56.034 --> 00:42:57.077
- What's going on?
- He can walk right in here.

00:42:57.243 --> 00:42:58.787
He can walk right
under Eywa's nose.

00:42:58.954 --> 00:43:00.956
- This is our family. This is our home.
- This is about our family.

00:43:01.122 --> 00:43:02.457
This is about
our little ones.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.835
I cannot. You cannot ask this.

00:43:08.088 --> 00:43:09.756
I cannot leave
my People.

00:43:11.007 --> 00:43:11.758
I will not.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.385
He's hunting us.

00:43:15.262 --> 00:43:16.388
He's targeting
our family.

00:43:16.513 --> 00:43:17.806
You cannot
ask this!

00:43:18.306 --> 00:43:21.101
The children. Everything they've
ever known. The forest.

00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:22.686
This is
our home!

00:43:22.852 --> 00:43:24.020
He had
our children.

00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:25.814
He had 'em
under his knife!

00:43:33.238 --> 00:43:34.823
My father gave me...

00:43:34.948 --> 00:43:37.158
this bow
as he lay dying.

00:43:37.325 --> 00:43:39.411
And he said
protect the People.

00:43:40.704 --> 00:43:42.330
You're
Toruk Makto!

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.166
This will protect the People!

00:43:45.625 --> 00:43:46.876
Quaritch
has Spider.

00:43:47.002 --> 00:43:48.211
And that kid
knows everything.

00:43:48.378 --> 00:43:49.671
He knows our
whole operation...

00:43:49.796 --> 00:43:51.131
and he can lead
them right in here.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.342
If the People harbor
us, they will die.

00:43:55.927 --> 00:43:57.095
Do you
understand?

00:44:01.766 --> 00:44:02.892
Look, I
got nothing.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:04.978
I got
no plan...

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.940
But I can protect this family.

00:44:09.065 --> 00:44:10.775
That I can do.

00:44:24.164 --> 00:44:25.749
I know
one thing.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:29.920
Wherever we go...

00:44:30.045 --> 00:44:31.838
this family is our fortress.

00:44:45.727 --> 00:44:47.187
Where is Jake Sully?

00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:48.480
I don't know!

00:44:50.315 --> 00:44:51.524
We know that
you know.

00:44:52.359 --> 00:44:53.693
I don't know!

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:54.736
Just form a picture...

00:44:54.861 --> 00:44:55.528
in your mind.

00:44:55.904 --> 00:44:57.405
Is it one of the
floating mountains?

00:44:58.323 --> 00:44:59.491
Let me
out of here!

00:44:59.658 --> 00:45:01.117
He's fighting us.
Give us a minute.

00:45:01.284 --> 00:45:01.993
I don't know!

00:45:02.452 --> 00:45:04.621
Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:07.082
I don't know!

00:45:07.791 --> 00:45:09.918
Look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

00:45:10.835 --> 00:45:12.504
Which clans would be harboring him?

00:45:12.504 --> 00:45:13.213
I don't know!

00:45:13.213 --> 00:45:14.547
You're gonna
have to kill me!

00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:17.217
Watch this.

00:45:17.342 --> 00:45:18.927
You're peaking all
over the prefrontal.

00:45:19.052 --> 00:45:20.136
It's not gonna stop...

00:45:20.262 --> 00:45:21.304
until you give
us something.

00:45:21.513 --> 00:45:22.806
Where is he?

00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:25.392
I don't know,
you buttholes! Okay?

00:45:25.558 --> 00:45:26.810
I don't know!

00:45:40.115 --> 00:45:42.575
General, let me try
the personal angle.

00:45:47.122 --> 00:45:48.415
He's not your son.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.114
Easy, tiger.

00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:22.157
Easy.

00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:32.042
We good?

00:46:38.673 --> 00:46:39.799
Kid, you
got heart.

00:46:40.884 --> 00:46:43.261
Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.

00:46:44.471 --> 00:46:45.972
But you gave
them nothin'.

00:46:48.141 --> 00:46:49.225
I respect that.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.775
I thought you
might want this.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.743
That's Colonel
Miles Quaritch.

00:47:07.535 --> 00:47:08.536
Deceased.

00:47:09.204 --> 00:47:10.372
Killed
in action.

00:47:16.086 --> 00:47:17.462
I'm not
that man.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.592
But I do have
his memories...

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.138
enough to
know that...

00:47:28.765 --> 00:47:30.016
well, he wasn't
always the best father.

00:47:31.893 --> 00:47:33.603
But that's
not an apology.

00:47:34.854 --> 00:47:37.148
I'm not your father. Technically...

00:47:37.315 --> 00:47:39.859
you and I, we're
nothin' to each other.

00:47:40.318 --> 00:47:41.319
But...

00:47:42.362 --> 00:47:43.613
I can
help you.

00:47:44.614 --> 00:47:46.116
I can get you
outta here.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.372
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

00:47:52.539 --> 00:47:54.582
I know you'd never
do that. You're loyal...

00:47:56.167 --> 00:47:57.502
and I
admire loyalty.

00:47:59.963 --> 00:48:01.298
Just ride along.

00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:06.803
Otherwise, I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

00:48:16.021 --> 00:48:17.814
This is like stones
in my heart.

00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:22.360
Tarsem is wise
for his years.

00:48:22.527 --> 00:48:24.279
He will be
a strong Olo'eyktan.

00:48:26.323 --> 00:48:28.116
The leader must die.

00:48:32.412 --> 00:48:34.247
So the leader
can be born.

00:48:37.208 --> 00:48:39.461
Toruk Makto
will disappear.

00:48:41.922 --> 00:48:43.506
The People
will be safe.

00:49:10.158 --> 00:49:12.035
A father protects.

00:49:13.286 --> 00:49:14.996
It's what gives
him meaning.

00:49:19.251 --> 00:49:20.752
One life ends.

00:49:21.878 --> 00:49:23.255
Another begins.

00:49:37.352 --> 00:49:38.353
Tuk.

00:49:42.482 --> 00:49:44.276
The sea clans are a
world unto themselves.

00:49:45.485 --> 00:49:47.028
Thousands of islands.

00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:51.783
An unknown territory into which
we could just vanish without a trace.

00:49:52.534 --> 00:49:54.244
Are we there yet?

00:51:00.101 --> 00:51:01.019
Hey...

00:51:01.144 --> 00:51:01.770
leave it.

00:51:03.647 --> 00:51:04.648
On me.

00:51:06.816 --> 00:51:07.817
Tuk.

00:51:09.319 --> 00:51:10.320
Be nice.

00:51:12.322 --> 00:51:13.114
Be nice.

00:51:13.865 --> 00:51:14.866
Hey.

00:51:33.468 --> 00:51:34.761
Easy.
Just be cool.

00:51:35.512 --> 00:51:36.638
Look.
What is that?

00:51:37.472 --> 00:51:38.723
Is that supposed
to be a tail?

00:51:56.324 --> 00:51:57.367
It's too small.

00:51:57.534 --> 00:51:58.535
How are they
supposed to swim?

00:51:58.702 --> 00:52:01.079
Do not.
Rotxo, Aonung.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:04.791
Hey.

00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:32.277
Tonowari was the chief
of the Metkayina...

00:52:32.819 --> 00:52:33.820
the Reef People.

00:52:34.738 --> 00:52:36.031
I See you, Tonowari.

00:52:37.115 --> 00:52:38.283
Jakesully.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:39.784
I knew him as
a tough leader.

00:52:44.623 --> 00:52:46.458
But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.

00:52:50.837 --> 00:52:52.422
I See you, Ronal.

00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:53.882
Tsahik of
the Metkayina.

00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:55.216
I See you, Ronal.

00:52:57.469 --> 00:52:59.471
Why do you come
to us, Jakesully?

00:53:00.764 --> 00:53:01.848
We seek uturu.

00:53:04.142 --> 00:53:05.644
Yes, sanctuary
for my family.

00:53:08.772 --> 00:53:10.482
We are
Reef People.

00:53:10.649 --> 00:53:11.358
You are
Forest People.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.360
Your skills will
mean nothing here.

00:53:14.152 --> 00:53:16.404
Well, we will learn
your ways. Am I right?

00:53:16.571 --> 00:53:17.572
Yes.

00:53:20.951 --> 00:53:22.285
Their arms
are thin.

00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:24.120
Mom.

00:53:24.245 --> 00:53:25.038
Their tails...

00:53:25.372 --> 00:53:26.706
are weak.

00:53:26.873 --> 00:53:28.458
You will be
slow in the water.

00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:33.004
These children...

00:53:33.171 --> 00:53:35.006
- are not even true Na'vi.
- Dad.

00:53:36.967 --> 00:53:38.176
Yes, we are!

00:53:41.721 --> 00:53:43.139
They have
demon blood!

00:53:48.144 --> 00:53:49.437
Look. Look.

00:53:51.439 --> 00:53:53.483
Look, I was born of the Sky
People, and now I am Na'vi.

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:54.943
All right?
You can adapt.

00:53:55.568 --> 00:53:56.778
We will adapt.

00:53:57.028 --> 00:53:57.737
Okay?

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.116
My husband
was Toruk Makto.

00:54:02.993 --> 00:54:03.952
He led the clans to...

00:54:04.077 --> 00:54:07.080
victory against the Sky People.

00:54:10.834 --> 00:54:12.043
This you
call victory?

00:54:13.211 --> 00:54:14.879
Hiding among
strangers?

00:54:19.175 --> 00:54:21.970
It seems Eywa has
turned her back on you...

00:54:22.095 --> 00:54:22.929
Chosen One.

00:54:29.019 --> 00:54:30.812
I apologize for
my mate. She's...

00:54:30.979 --> 00:54:32.397
Do not
apologize for me.

00:54:32.522 --> 00:54:33.773
...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

00:54:33.773 --> 00:54:34.691
Jake.

00:54:39.863 --> 00:54:42.449
Toruk Makto is a
great war leader.

00:54:43.283 --> 00:54:45.952
All Na'vi people know his story.

00:54:46.119 --> 00:54:47.495
But we Metkayina...

00:54:47.662 --> 00:54:49.080
- Dad.
- ...are not at war.

00:54:51.958 --> 00:54:54.711
We cannot let you
bring your war here.

00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:56.755
I'm done
with war.

00:54:56.922 --> 00:54:57.923
Okay?

00:54:58.506 --> 00:55:00.425
I just want to keep
my family safe.

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:06.932
Uturu has
been asked.

00:55:11.853 --> 00:55:12.979
Do we have to go?

00:55:13.772 --> 00:55:14.773
We'll be okay.

00:55:27.494 --> 00:55:29.996
Toruk Makto and his
family will stay with us.

00:55:31.206 --> 00:55:33.541
Treat them as our
brothers and sisters.

00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:36.836
Now, they do not
know the sea.

00:55:37.712 --> 00:55:39.464
So they will be
like babies...

00:55:40.257 --> 00:55:41.132
taking their...

00:55:41.258 --> 00:55:42.259
first breath.

00:55:42.926 --> 00:55:47.138
Teach them our ways, so they
do not suffer the shame of being...

00:55:47.264 --> 00:55:48.598
useless.

00:55:50.767 --> 00:55:51.518
Okay, what
do we say?

00:55:51.643 --> 00:55:52.727
Thank you.

00:55:52.852 --> 00:55:53.770
Thank you.

00:55:54.104 --> 00:55:55.105
Thank you.

00:55:55.647 --> 00:55:59.317
My son, Aonung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

00:55:59.693 --> 00:56:01.319
- Father, why do...
- It is decided.

00:56:02.195 --> 00:56:04.864
Come. I will show
you our village.

00:56:15.417 --> 00:56:16.418
This way.

00:56:19.754 --> 00:56:21.298
Tuk, let's go.

00:56:21.798 --> 00:56:22.841
Just up here.

00:56:31.474 --> 00:56:32.726
This is for you.

00:56:33.476 --> 00:56:34.477
Your new home.

00:56:35.854 --> 00:56:36.855
Yeah, this will work.

00:56:37.856 --> 00:56:38.940
This is great.

00:56:39.107 --> 00:56:40.108
It's nice, right?

00:56:53.663 --> 00:56:54.789
Okay, Sullys, fall in.

00:56:54.956 --> 00:56:55.749
Remember?

00:56:55.874 --> 00:56:56.708
Family
meeting.

00:56:56.875 --> 00:56:57.876
Come on. Take
a knee. Let's go.

00:56:58.043 --> 00:56:58.919
Kiri.

00:56:59.336 --> 00:57:00.337
What?

00:57:00.503 --> 00:57:02.088
Okay.

00:57:02.255 --> 00:57:03.924
I need
you kids

00:57:04.049 --> 00:57:05.717
on your best behavior.

00:57:05.884 --> 00:57:07.385
I mean it.

00:57:07.552 --> 00:57:09.012
Learn fast.
Pull your weight.

00:57:10.055 --> 00:57:12.349
Don't cause trouble.
You got it?

00:57:12.515 --> 00:57:13.767
Yes, sir.

00:57:16.227 --> 00:57:17.979
I want to
go home.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.566
Oh, Tuk.

00:57:22.192 --> 00:57:25.570
Tuk, this is
our home now.

00:57:26.947 --> 00:57:30.367
Now we're gonna
get through this.

00:57:30.533 --> 00:57:31.493
We're gonna
get through this

00:57:31.618 --> 00:57:33.453
if we have each
other's backs. All right?

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.622
What does your
father always say?

00:57:36.247 --> 00:57:38.667
Sullys stick together.

00:57:38.833 --> 00:57:41.044
That's right.
Sullys stick together.

00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:42.837
Now this time
with some feeling.

00:57:43.004 --> 00:57:44.339
Yeah.

00:57:44.506 --> 00:57:45.298
Sullys stick together.

00:57:45.465 --> 00:57:46.758
Sullys stick together.

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.677
Sullys stick together.

00:57:59.271 --> 00:58:00.272
Come on.

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:33.758
Are you all right?

01:00:33.925 --> 01:00:34.593
You're too fast!

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.261
Wait for us.

01:00:37.178 --> 01:00:38.263
Just breathe.

01:00:38.388 --> 01:00:39.347
Breathe.

01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:40.640
You are not
good divers.

01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:43.602
Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:45.186
Come on, bro.

01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:47.355
We don't speak this
finger talk, guys.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.481
We don't know
what you're saying.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.941
I will teach you.

01:00:50.108 --> 01:00:51.443
- Where is Kiri?
- Kiri?

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:52.611
- Who?
- Kiri.

01:00:52.777 --> 01:00:53.778
Where is Kiri?

01:00:53.945 --> 01:00:55.196
Did you see her?

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.292
Get on the ship...

01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:08.960
find a seat, and
keep out of the way.

01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:11.504
Let's go!

01:01:12.339 --> 01:01:13.298
Chop-chop.

01:01:13.423 --> 01:01:14.257
Sweet.

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:16.885
Whoa, hold on
there, hotshot!

01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:19.095
You listen up.

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:22.557
There's a tracker
built in that mask.

01:01:22.724 --> 01:01:24.726
We hit the ground,
and you take off...

01:01:24.893 --> 01:01:27.062
I'll have you back
in two minutes...

01:01:27.228 --> 01:01:29.814
and I will give you a
old-school ass-whippin'.

01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:30.982
Understood?

01:01:32.108 --> 01:01:33.234
Understood?

01:01:33.735 --> 01:01:34.903
Yes, sir.

01:01:35.278 --> 01:01:36.279
We up?

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:37.447
Team's up.

01:01:52.003 --> 01:01:53.129
All right,
listen up.

01:01:54.506 --> 01:01:56.716
Jake Sully's
gone to ground.

01:01:57.217 --> 01:01:58.218
Don't
matter.

01:01:58.385 --> 01:01:59.761
Wherever he is,
we'll find him...

01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:02.681
and his batshit
crazy wife, too.

01:02:04.307 --> 01:02:05.558
To do so...

01:02:05.684 --> 01:02:07.936
we go Na'vi.

01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.437
Full tilt,
all the way.

01:02:09.604 --> 01:02:10.230
That means we...

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:13.858
eat Na'vi.
We ride Na'vi.

01:02:14.025 --> 01:02:15.860
Think Na'vi.

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:32.711
All right, smart guy.

01:02:33.628 --> 01:02:36.047
You just went from bein'
our monkey mascot...

01:02:36.172 --> 01:02:37.799
to official interpreter.

01:02:45.056 --> 01:02:46.558
These are ilu.

01:02:47.017 --> 01:02:48.602
If you want
to live here...

01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:50.020
you have to ride.

01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:52.355
Make the
bond gently.

01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.571
Feel his breath.

01:02:59.738 --> 01:03:01.197
Feel his strength.

01:03:03.408 --> 01:03:04.409
Hold here.

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:08.121
Hold on.

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:28.516
You all right...

01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:29.684
Forest Boy?

01:03:39.694 --> 01:03:41.237
This is a
warrior's mount.

01:03:41.404 --> 01:03:42.739
Not easy
to master.

01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:45.408
Perhaps
you should...

01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:46.618
start with
an ilu.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.244
Nah.
This one.

01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:52.832
Now remember...

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:55.627
when you dive back
in, good position.

01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:56.795
Very important.

01:04:00.423 --> 01:04:01.424
I got this.

01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:29.369
That's it, okay.

01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:31.579
Steady.

01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:47.345
Ah, shit.

01:05:18.084 --> 01:05:19.836
I love her already.

01:06:00.001 --> 01:06:01.044
Breathe in.

01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:05.882
And breathe out.

01:06:07.008 --> 01:06:09.135
Imagine flickering
a flame.

01:06:11.221 --> 01:06:14.224
You must slow down
your heartbeat.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:16.768
Breathe in.

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:20.230
Breathe from
down here.

01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:23.692
Breathe out slowly.

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.405
Lo'ak, your
heartbeat is fast.

01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:30.198
- Sorry.
- Try to focus.

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:31.825
- Okay.
- Breathe in.

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:35.578
And breathe out.

01:06:35.745 --> 01:06:37.289
Let your mind go clear.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.226
You are learning
to breathe.

01:07:03.815 --> 01:07:05.692
Come on!
Keep up, losers!

01:07:20.248 --> 01:07:21.249
I got this.

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.174
What?

01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:32.135
Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:36.389
Jake Sully did it
the hard way?

01:07:37.098 --> 01:07:38.308
What do
you think?

01:07:41.853 --> 01:07:42.938
What are we
doin', Colonel?

01:07:47.984 --> 01:07:49.027
This is gonna
be good.

01:07:52.405 --> 01:07:53.615
All right, move up.

01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:02.582
It's you and me, cupcake.

01:08:16.137 --> 01:08:18.306
Did I mention you're
supposed to tie the mouth shut first?

01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:20.683
Thanks a lot, kid!

01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:26.272
Move up,
move up!

01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:35.781
You see 'em?

01:08:58.096 --> 01:08:59.806
All right, let's go.
We're Oscar Mike.

01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:00.557
Come on.

01:09:03.768 --> 01:09:05.145
Let's go.
We're outta here.

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:12.235
Yeah!

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:13.820
That's right!

01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:17.991
Yeah, Colonel!
Get some!

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:19.116
Yeah, Colonel!

01:09:19.284 --> 01:09:20.535
Who's up next?

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:32.839
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

01:09:37.509 --> 01:09:39.553
The sea is around you...

01:09:40.138 --> 01:09:40.847
and in you.

01:09:47.437 --> 01:09:49.940
The sea is your home...

01:09:50.565 --> 01:09:52.359
before your birth...

01:09:53.317 --> 01:09:55.153
and after your death.

01:10:00.867 --> 01:10:04.454
Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.

01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:11.253
Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.

01:10:12.587 --> 01:10:14.422
The sea gives...

01:10:15.799 --> 01:10:17.592
and the sea takes.

01:10:20.595 --> 01:10:23.515
Water connects all things.

01:10:25.684 --> 01:10:27.519
Life to death.

01:10:29.688 --> 01:10:30.689
Darkness...

01:10:32.357 --> 01:10:33.149
to light.

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:35.944
I got it!

01:10:37.195 --> 01:10:37.904
You did it!

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:42.302
What is
she doing?

01:11:43.053 --> 01:11:44.054
I don't know.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.805
She's just looking
at the sand.

01:11:48.516 --> 01:11:49.684
What'd you say?

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.687
Are you some
kind of... freak?

01:11:53.521 --> 01:11:54.981
He asked if
you are a freak.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:58.985
No.

01:11:59.778 --> 01:12:00.904
Are you sure?

01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:02.614
I mean, you're
not even real Na'vi.

01:12:03.323 --> 01:12:04.658
Look at
these hands.

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:06.076
I mean,
look at them...

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:07.911
Hey!

01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:09.788
Back off,
fishlips!

01:12:09.955 --> 01:12:12.207
Oh, another
four-fingered freak.

01:12:12.374 --> 01:12:13.541
Look at his
little baby tail!

01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:14.709
Don't
touch me!

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:15.460
Baby tail!

01:12:15.585 --> 01:12:16.795
Leave us alone!

01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:18.088
He's not normal.

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.256
Look at his tail.

01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:20.131
Aw, baby tail!

01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:21.549
It is so cute!

01:12:22.968 --> 01:12:24.094
You heard
what she said.

01:12:25.053 --> 01:12:26.263
Leave
them alone.

01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:27.889
Ah, big
brother come...

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.475
Back off.

01:12:31.601 --> 01:12:32.769
Now.

01:12:38.608 --> 01:12:39.985
Smart choice.

01:12:40.402 --> 01:12:41.820
And from
now on...

01:12:41.987 --> 01:12:43.989
I need you to
respect my sister.

01:12:48.368 --> 01:12:48.994
Let's go.

01:12:52.247 --> 01:12:53.665
Buh-bye!

01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:55.000
Look at them.

01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:56.167
They're all freaks.

01:12:56.334 --> 01:12:57.335
The whole family.

01:12:59.629 --> 01:13:00.630
Lo'ak.

01:13:00.797 --> 01:13:01.798
I got this, bro.

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:06.886
I know this
hand is funny.

01:13:07.053 --> 01:13:09.639
Look, I'm a freak.
An alien.

01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:12.809
But it can do
something really cool.

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:13.977
Watch.

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:16.479
First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

01:13:16.646 --> 01:13:17.772
Okay? Then...

01:13:21.985 --> 01:13:23.028
It's called a
punch, bitch!

01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:24.529
Don't ever touch
my sister again.

01:13:26.114 --> 01:13:27.741
Yeah! Aonung!
Show him!

01:13:29.743 --> 01:13:30.744
Come here!

01:13:31.953 --> 01:13:32.954
Hey!
Hey!

01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:38.752
Stop this!

01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:40.670
Stop it!

01:13:42.923 --> 01:13:44.049
So stupid!

01:13:47.427 --> 01:13:48.428
Ow, my tail!

01:13:50.388 --> 01:13:52.474
My ear!
Let go!

01:13:52.807 --> 01:13:54.976
He's got my ear!

01:13:59.856 --> 01:14:01.691
What was the
one thing I asked?

01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:02.442
The one thing!

01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:03.777
- Stay out of trouble.
- Stay out of trouble.

01:14:03.944 --> 01:14:04.945
- Right.
- It was my fault.

01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:05.779
I don't think so.

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:07.489
You gotta stop takin' the
heat for this knucklehead.

01:14:07.656 --> 01:14:09.407
Look, Dad. Aonung
was picking on Kiri.

01:14:10.116 --> 01:14:11.117
He called
her a freak.

01:14:15.205 --> 01:14:16.414
Go apologize
to Aonung.

01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:17.874
What?

01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:19.960
He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?

01:14:20.919 --> 01:14:22.629
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.

01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:24.089
Just go.

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:30.262
Hey.

01:14:32.222 --> 01:14:33.556
So what'd the
other guys look like?

01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.433
Worse.

01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:37.102
That's good.

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:38.687
A lot worse.

01:14:38.979 --> 01:14:40.188
Get outta here.

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:52.867
What is wrong?

01:14:54.869 --> 01:14:56.663
Nothing. I'm fine.

01:14:57.831 --> 01:14:59.666
Why should I not be fine?

01:15:07.048 --> 01:15:09.342
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:12.721
Oh, Kiri.

01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:18.643
Ah, what's tree
boy doing here?

01:15:21.938 --> 01:15:23.023
I'm sorry
I hit you.

01:15:23.898 --> 01:15:25.066
So many times.

01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:33.074
We should
be friends.

01:15:35.702 --> 01:15:36.703
Come hunting with us.

01:15:37.412 --> 01:15:38.538
Outside
the reef.

01:15:39.372 --> 01:15:40.874
It's where
the men hunt.

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:43.043
No way.
I'm not allowed.

01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:46.046
I must be asking
the wrong brother.

01:15:47.213 --> 01:15:47.964
Let's do it.

01:16:03.146 --> 01:16:04.731
Come on! Come on!

01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:06.691
Yeah!

01:16:14.616 --> 01:16:16.076
Keep up, Forest Boy!

01:16:17.619 --> 01:16:18.453
Yeah!

01:16:31.383 --> 01:16:32.884
Hey, you lived!

01:16:33.468 --> 01:16:34.970
That was
insane, cuz!

01:16:36.137 --> 01:16:37.138
This way.

01:16:37.264 --> 01:16:38.223
I know a
good spot.

01:17:30.609 --> 01:17:31.610
Hey, guys!

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.361
Hey!

01:17:35.947 --> 01:17:36.948
Aonung!

01:17:38.491 --> 01:17:39.868
Come on, this isn't funny!

01:17:52.047 --> 01:17:53.048
Hey,
Aonung!

01:21:27.971 --> 01:21:28.888
Holy shit.

01:21:58.293 --> 01:21:59.294
You're a tulkun.

01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:04.090
You saved my life.

01:22:04.758 --> 01:22:05.759
Thank you.

01:22:07.177 --> 01:22:08.178
Thank you.

01:22:15.018 --> 01:22:17.020
Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

01:22:24.027 --> 01:22:25.612
They hurt you, didn't they?

01:22:27.989 --> 01:22:29.240
I'll try to
pull it out.

01:22:30.784 --> 01:22:31.910
Just trust me, okay?

01:23:06.987 --> 01:23:07.988
Friends?

01:23:11.616 --> 01:23:13.868
That's right, we're
friends. Friends.

01:23:18.707 --> 01:23:19.374
Bro!

01:25:11.486 --> 01:25:13.113
So, what is it,
baby girl?

01:25:14.447 --> 01:25:15.573
You missin'
Spider?

01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:19.995
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:25:21.121 --> 01:25:22.372
But that's
not it.

01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:25.875
Okay...

01:25:27.752 --> 01:25:28.753
So what is it?

01:25:29.963 --> 01:25:31.298
I feel her, Dad.

01:25:33.967 --> 01:25:34.968
You feel who?

01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:36.720
Eywa.

01:25:41.433 --> 01:25:42.934
I hear her breathing.

01:25:44.311 --> 01:25:45.812
I hear her heartbeat.

01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:48.648
She's so close.

01:25:49.899 --> 01:25:52.110
She's just there...

01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:55.864
like a word about
to be spoken.

01:26:01.828 --> 01:26:03.663
I know you think I'm crazy.

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:08.418
You're not crazy,
baby girl.

01:26:12.839 --> 01:26:15.175
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

01:26:20.263 --> 01:26:21.556
Mighty.

01:26:29.272 --> 01:26:30.732
Tell him what
you told me!

01:26:36.529 --> 01:26:38.114
You like lookin' at the stars?

01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:43.203
You know, my dad
came from a star.

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:45.705
That one.

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:46.456
Right there.

01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:51.002
Lo'ak!

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:52.754
Oh, man.
I'm in trouble.

01:26:55.674 --> 01:26:56.383
Go.

01:26:56.508 --> 01:26:57.509
I will see
you again.

01:27:16.194 --> 01:27:18.238
- The boy has returned!
- It is the Sully boy.

01:27:18.363 --> 01:27:19.906
- They found the boy.
- They found him.

01:27:25.578 --> 01:27:26.579
Hey, hey.

01:27:28.915 --> 01:27:30.041
Let's have a
look at you. Okay.

01:27:31.626 --> 01:27:32.919
He's fine.
He's fine...

01:27:32.919 --> 01:27:33.628
yeah.

01:27:33.628 --> 01:27:35.005
Just a few scratches.

01:27:38.049 --> 01:27:39.551
I pray for the strength
that I will not...

01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:41.595
pluck the eyeballs out
of my youngest son!

01:27:43.263 --> 01:27:44.264
No.

01:27:44.723 --> 01:27:47.309
My son knows better
than to take him outside the reef.

01:27:49.769 --> 01:27:51.479
The blame is his.

01:27:52.772 --> 01:27:54.190
Okay,
let's go.

01:27:54.691 --> 01:27:55.692
No.

01:27:56.151 --> 01:27:57.360
This is not
Aonung's fault.

01:27:58.111 --> 01:27:59.362
This was my idea.

01:27:59.529 --> 01:28:01.031
Aonung tried to
talk me out of it.

01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.991
Really.

01:28:03.658 --> 01:28:04.284
Come on.

01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:06.953
I'm sorry.

01:28:07.704 --> 01:28:08.330
Come on.

01:28:11.666 --> 01:28:12.667
I got this.

01:28:15.921 --> 01:28:17.464
Is this true?

01:28:17.589 --> 01:28:19.633
Aonung. What
were you thinking?

01:28:22.886 --> 01:28:24.846
Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

01:28:25.013 --> 01:28:26.848
- That's all I was trying to...
- I don't want to hear it.

01:28:27.015 --> 01:28:28.016
Dad...

01:28:28.183 --> 01:28:29.684
You brought shame
to this family.

01:28:32.979 --> 01:28:34.105
Can I go now?

01:28:34.648 --> 01:28:36.274
Any more trouble, I
jerk a knot in your tail.

01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:37.525
You read me?

01:28:38.068 --> 01:28:39.986
Yes, sir.
Lima Charlie.

01:28:50.705 --> 01:28:51.915
Where
were you?

01:28:52.082 --> 01:28:53.041
Yeah.

01:28:53.166 --> 01:28:55.043
What happened to "keep
an eye on your brother"?

01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:56.711
Sorry, sir.

01:29:01.341 --> 01:29:02.926
Why did you
speak for me?

01:29:03.635 --> 01:29:04.886
Because I know
what it's like...

01:29:05.053 --> 01:29:06.388
to be one big disappointment.

01:29:10.016 --> 01:29:11.893
I wish I'd
been there.

01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:13.979
The ocean blessed
you with a gift, brother.

01:29:14.646 --> 01:29:16.982
The tulkun have not returned yet.

01:29:17.148 --> 01:29:19.109
And anyway, no tulkun is ever alone.

01:29:19.901 --> 01:29:20.986
Well, this one was.

01:29:21.903 --> 01:29:23.738
He had a
missing fin.

01:29:23.905 --> 01:29:24.823
Like a stump.

01:29:24.948 --> 01:29:25.573
On the
left side.

01:29:25.573 --> 01:29:26.783
Poor tulkun.

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:28.493
Payakan.

01:29:30.495 --> 01:29:31.371
Who's Payakan?

01:29:32.163 --> 01:29:33.832
A young bull
who went rogue.

01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:35.584
He's outcast. Alone.

01:29:36.126 --> 01:29:37.252
And he has a missing fin.

01:29:37.502 --> 01:29:38.920
They say
he is a killer.

01:29:39.087 --> 01:29:40.964
- No, no.
- He killed Na'vi...

01:29:41.089 --> 01:29:43.008
and other tulkun.

01:29:44.467 --> 01:29:45.343
Not here...

01:29:45.468 --> 01:29:46.261
but far to the south.

01:29:46.428 --> 01:29:47.137
No, he's no killer.

01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:50.640
You are lucky to be alive.

01:29:50.807 --> 01:29:52.142
I'm telling you guys.

01:29:52.267 --> 01:29:53.351
He saved my life.

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.145
He's my friend.

01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:56.938
My baby
bro!

01:29:57.105 --> 01:29:58.148
The Mighty Warrior...

01:29:58.732 --> 01:29:59.941
who faced the killer tulkun...

01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:00.859
and lived to tell about it, huh?

01:30:03.278 --> 01:30:04.362
You guys
aren't listening.

01:30:05.405 --> 01:30:08.366
- Lo'ak, I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back.

01:30:08.533 --> 01:30:09.826
You skxawngs.

01:30:10.952 --> 01:30:11.578
Payakan!

01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:14.706
Payakan!

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.335
Payakan!

01:30:27.218 --> 01:30:28.136
It's good
to see you.

01:30:31.556 --> 01:30:33.183
Why are
you outcast?

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:34.351
What happened?

01:30:40.065 --> 01:30:42.317
I trust you.

01:30:43.026 --> 01:30:45.153
You can trust me.

01:31:30.949 --> 01:31:32.158
Bro, that's
disgusting!

01:32:13.783 --> 01:32:14.993
We are here.

01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:23.752
This is the Cove
of the Ancestors.

01:32:23.919 --> 01:32:25.462
Our most
sacred place.

01:32:32.552 --> 01:32:35.513
Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.

01:32:48.818 --> 01:32:49.819
This is it.

01:32:50.403 --> 01:32:51.738
This is the Spirit Tree.

01:33:58.638 --> 01:34:00.098
My beautiful daughter.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:02.601
Hi, Ma.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.811
I'm so happy
to see you.

01:34:05.937 --> 01:34:06.938
But you
look troubled.

01:34:13.403 --> 01:34:14.404
My sweet girl.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.656
It will be okay.

01:34:24.205 --> 01:34:25.373
What is it, baby?

01:34:26.791 --> 01:34:28.126
Why am I
different?

01:34:30.795 --> 01:34:33.006
What does the Great
Mother want from me?

01:34:36.635 --> 01:34:38.595
Who was
my father?

01:34:42.724 --> 01:34:44.309
Oh, my darling.

01:34:49.064 --> 01:34:50.315
No!

01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:09.626
Come on.

01:35:15.632 --> 01:35:16.967
What is wrong?
What is it?

01:35:17.759 --> 01:35:18.843
It was a seizure.

01:35:19.469 --> 01:35:20.470
Is she breathing?

01:35:20.971 --> 01:35:22.097
Is she
breathing?

01:35:25.642 --> 01:35:26.810
Get her
to the village!

01:35:26.935 --> 01:35:27.560
Hurry!

01:35:27.686 --> 01:35:28.937
Let's go!
Let's move!

01:35:29.062 --> 01:35:29.729
Tuk, come.

01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:46.162
- Hi!
- It's good to see you.

01:35:46.329 --> 01:35:47.455
Let's get the gear.
Neteyam!

01:35:47.622 --> 01:35:48.665
Neteyam, keep
them back!

01:35:48.832 --> 01:35:49.624
How is she?

01:35:49.791 --> 01:35:50.917
She's still unconscious.

01:35:51.876 --> 01:35:53.044
There's no bleed.

01:35:53.169 --> 01:35:54.254
There's no fracture.

01:35:55.297 --> 01:35:56.881
No effects of hypoxia.

01:35:57.048 --> 01:35:58.174
The brain looks good.

01:36:02.846 --> 01:36:05.807
But we still have this interictal
activity right here in the prefrontal.

01:36:05.974 --> 01:36:07.767
- Okay.
- She's definitely had a seizure.

01:36:07.934 --> 01:36:10.186
- I think we can rule out toxins.
- So what is it?

01:36:11.438 --> 01:36:12.981
I see that I am
not needed here.

01:36:13.648 --> 01:36:15.066
You are Tsahik!

01:36:17.027 --> 01:36:18.320
Remove
these things.

01:36:19.154 --> 01:36:20.155
Out!

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:20.989
You have
done nothing!

01:36:21.156 --> 01:36:22.657
Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:24.868
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:27.579
Tuktirey.

01:36:36.087 --> 01:36:39.299
She said that she can feel Eywa.
She can hear her heartbeat.

01:36:39.466 --> 01:36:40.592
- That's it.
- What?

01:36:40.759 --> 01:36:42.969
That is classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

01:36:43.595 --> 01:36:44.596
- Epilepsy?
- Yep.

01:36:44.763 --> 01:36:46.806
You see visions.
You get...

01:36:46.973 --> 01:36:49.309
states of religious ecstasy
like the kind she's describing.

01:36:57.525 --> 01:37:00.946
Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

01:37:01.112 --> 01:37:02.906
You definitely can't let
her do that anymore.

01:37:05.158 --> 01:37:06.201
What? Ever?

01:37:06.368 --> 01:37:07.369
Jake.

01:37:07.911 --> 01:37:09.746
If she seizes
underwater again...

01:37:10.497 --> 01:37:11.706
it could kill her.

01:37:24.094 --> 01:37:25.095
You're awake!

01:37:34.104 --> 01:37:35.605
Kiri, my sweet child.

01:37:36.439 --> 01:37:37.983
Oh, my sweet little girl.

01:37:38.733 --> 01:37:39.734
Okay, this one.

01:37:39.859 --> 01:37:40.735
"I See you."

01:37:47.158 --> 01:37:48.410
That's what I
just said, isn't it?

01:37:50.578 --> 01:37:53.039
Not "Naati. Ngaati."

01:37:54.165 --> 01:37:56.418
All right. Like comin'
out your nose or something.

01:37:57.335 --> 01:37:58.336
Boss...

01:37:59.045 --> 01:38:00.922
long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

01:38:01.089 --> 01:38:02.382
A rogue gunship.

01:38:03.383 --> 01:38:04.384
Where?

01:38:04.551 --> 01:38:06.136
Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.

01:38:09.097 --> 01:38:10.098
Hang on.

01:38:12.726 --> 01:38:16.855
The signal was intermittent,
and they lost it over open water but...

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:18.940
if you project the track...

01:38:20.275 --> 01:38:22.027
it hits this island group.

01:38:23.194 --> 01:38:25.071
That's hundreds
of islands.

01:38:25.238 --> 01:38:27.324
That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:28.575
This is our guy.

01:38:29.409 --> 01:38:32.495
You give me ships and aircraft,
I'll bring you back his scalp.

01:38:44.549 --> 01:38:45.675
Bogies inbound.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:46.509
Skipper.

01:38:54.851 --> 01:38:56.394
- All stop.
- All stop.

01:38:56.561 --> 01:38:57.812
All stop. Aye.

01:39:16.748 --> 01:39:17.791
Hey.

01:39:18.291 --> 01:39:19.501
You Scoresby?

01:39:20.877 --> 01:39:23.797
Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

01:39:24.339 --> 01:39:25.548
That would
be me.

01:39:27.133 --> 01:39:30.136
The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

01:39:30.929 --> 01:39:32.097
Never been up there.

01:39:33.306 --> 01:39:35.767
You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

01:39:36.434 --> 01:39:39.896
Metkayina, mostly. Some
Ta'unui. Maybe fifty villages.

01:39:40.063 --> 01:39:41.481
And you
are who?

01:39:42.607 --> 01:39:43.900
I'm Ian Garvin.

01:39:45.193 --> 01:39:46.611
Marine biologist.

01:39:46.778 --> 01:39:47.988
Fifty villages.

01:39:48.113 --> 01:39:50.323
A hundred villages.
I don't care. We'll search 'em all.

01:39:51.491 --> 01:39:52.784
I hunt tulkun.

01:39:53.451 --> 01:39:55.787
That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

01:39:55.954 --> 01:39:57.539
I've got quotas to meet.

01:39:58.707 --> 01:40:00.625
I'll be nice once.

01:40:01.334 --> 01:40:02.335
Then I won't.

01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:07.048
Well, if you can't
get out of it...

01:40:08.258 --> 01:40:09.259
get into it!

01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:12.554
- All crews to stations!
- Hey, don't touch.

01:40:15.015 --> 01:40:15.682
Helm,
bring her up.

01:40:15.807 --> 01:40:16.600
Flight speed.

01:40:16.808 --> 01:40:18.059
Flight speed, aye.

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.113
What was that?

01:40:31.364 --> 01:40:32.157
What's going on?

01:40:35.619 --> 01:40:37.412
The tulkun have returned!

01:40:37.579 --> 01:40:40.624
Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

01:40:50.842 --> 01:40:53.053
In their endless cycle of migration...

01:40:53.345 --> 01:40:55.263
the tulkun had come home.

01:41:02.604 --> 01:41:04.022
Kiri, come on. Come on!

01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:05.482
Tuk, leave me alone.

01:41:05.607 --> 01:41:06.858
- Come on!
- What?

01:41:08.443 --> 01:41:09.736
What do you want?

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.946
Look.

01:41:19.829 --> 01:41:20.705
Come on.

01:41:21.748 --> 01:41:22.874
Let's go meet them.

01:41:23.667 --> 01:41:24.292
Look...

01:41:24.417 --> 01:41:25.752
it's my Spirit Sister.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.545
It was a time for stories.

01:42:51.755 --> 01:42:53.006
Of their season apart.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:54.507
Of deaths...

01:42:54.633 --> 01:42:55.258
and births.

01:42:57.719 --> 01:42:58.762
Of old friends...

01:42:58.887 --> 01:42:59.804
and new loves.

01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:20.909
Children.

01:43:23.703 --> 01:43:24.579
Be calm...

01:43:24.704 --> 01:43:25.747
my people.

01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:27.582
We're looking for weapons...

01:43:27.707 --> 01:43:29.668
comms. Any kind of tech.

01:43:30.168 --> 01:43:30.835
Get down.

01:43:31.002 --> 01:43:31.795
You too.

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.754
You see this?

01:43:33.713 --> 01:43:34.881
Stay down and shut up!

01:43:51.731 --> 01:43:52.774
Now what's
he saying?

01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:53.984
They never
saw him.

01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.985
These are
Sea People.

01:43:55.110 --> 01:43:56.653
Forest People
don't come here.

01:43:56.778 --> 01:43:58.321
I ain't buyin' that.

01:44:10.208 --> 01:44:11.751
They don't
know anything.

01:44:14.588 --> 01:44:15.589
Shoot that animal.

01:44:19.676 --> 01:44:20.635
What the hell are you doing?

01:44:32.397 --> 01:44:33.607
{\an8}Your ears
workin' now?

01:44:34.649 --> 01:44:36.401
You see what
these can do, huh?

01:44:38.695 --> 01:44:39.863
Jake Sully.

01:44:40.905 --> 01:44:43.450
Toruk Makto!

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.077
Put her down!

01:44:46.244 --> 01:44:47.078
Get down!

01:44:48.955 --> 01:44:49.831
Get down!

01:44:50.165 --> 01:44:51.041
Stop!

01:44:51.166 --> 01:44:51.833
Stop!

01:44:51.958 --> 01:44:53.710
You make it real
clear to him.

01:44:54.294 --> 01:44:55.420
He doesn't
give up Sully...

01:44:56.171 --> 01:44:57.464
we kill the Tsahik.

01:44:57.631 --> 01:44:58.965
No, I'm not
doin' that.

01:44:59.132 --> 01:45:00.091
Is that right?

01:45:00.717 --> 01:45:02.385
I'm not gonna be a part of this!

01:45:03.094 --> 01:45:03.720
Get down!

01:45:03.887 --> 01:45:05.305
These people don't
know anything!

01:45:05.472 --> 01:45:06.681
They don't know anything!

01:45:06.848 --> 01:45:08.016
Don't move!

01:45:12.479 --> 01:45:13.438
We really
gonna waste her?

01:45:14.773 --> 01:45:15.607
Please.

01:45:15.774 --> 01:45:17.150
Please don't do this.

01:45:17.275 --> 01:45:18.109
This is wrong.

01:45:18.276 --> 01:45:20.362
What you're
doing here is wrong.

01:45:21.613 --> 01:45:22.447
Please.

01:45:27.661 --> 01:45:28.870
Burn the hooches.

01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:31.373
Hey, light 'em up.

01:45:31.539 --> 01:45:32.999
Light 'em up. All of 'em!

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:34.626
Flamethrowers up!

01:45:52.102 --> 01:45:53.478
I'm sorry.

01:45:53.645 --> 01:45:54.813
We're outta here.

01:45:56.564 --> 01:45:57.691
Don't touch me!

01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.025
I'm sorry.

01:45:59.192 --> 01:46:00.193
Let's go.

01:46:00.568 --> 01:46:01.236
Saddle up.

01:46:01.361 --> 01:46:02.112
All right. Let's go.

01:46:27.053 --> 01:46:28.054
What's wrong?

01:46:28.221 --> 01:46:29.431
Sky People.

01:46:31.057 --> 01:46:32.892
They're looking
for you, Jakesully.

01:46:33.435 --> 01:46:34.269
South.

01:46:34.519 --> 01:46:35.270
They have a human...

01:46:35.395 --> 01:46:37.314
boy who speaks Na'vi.

01:46:41.318 --> 01:46:42.819
Did they kill anybody?

01:46:43.528 --> 01:46:44.904
Not yet.

01:46:46.197 --> 01:46:47.282
They threaten.

01:46:47.699 --> 01:46:50.160
But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

01:46:50.493 --> 01:46:51.578
By my order.

01:46:59.544 --> 01:47:01.963
We must hunt
this demon.

01:47:02.130 --> 01:47:03.173
Trap him.

01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.257
Kill him.

01:47:05.967 --> 01:47:07.052
We've gotta be smart.

01:47:07.844 --> 01:47:08.845
We gotta be smart.

01:47:09.012 --> 01:47:09.846
If we hit Quaritch...

01:47:09.971 --> 01:47:11.932
they're gonna
know where we are...

01:47:12.098 --> 01:47:14.309
and they're gonna come
here with everything they've got.

01:47:15.727 --> 01:47:17.062
Then what is our plan?

01:47:18.772 --> 01:47:20.023
That's
Toruk Makto!

01:47:20.273 --> 01:47:21.024
Head down.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:23.109
Has he been here?

01:47:27.906 --> 01:47:29.115
This shit ain't workin'.

01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:31.242
Nah, they're
stonewallin' us.

01:47:31.993 --> 01:47:33.453
If we turn up the heat...

01:47:33.578 --> 01:47:35.038
he's just gonna keep runnin'.

01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:36.831
We gotta
draw him out.

01:47:46.258 --> 01:47:47.342
I'm over it.

01:47:48.551 --> 01:47:50.720
I've got quotas to meet.

01:47:50.887 --> 01:47:52.472
You wanna hunt?

01:47:52.847 --> 01:47:54.099
Let's hunt.

01:47:55.558 --> 01:47:56.393
Here? Not here.

01:47:56.518 --> 01:47:57.811
There's too many villages.

01:47:57.936 --> 01:47:59.396
No.
No, no, no.

01:48:00.689 --> 01:48:01.898
Respectfully, sir...

01:48:02.565 --> 01:48:03.525
you do not understand...

01:48:03.692 --> 01:48:04.567
the kinship bonds...

01:48:04.693 --> 01:48:06.444
between the tulkun
and the ocean Na'vi.

01:48:06.611 --> 01:48:08.780
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

01:48:08.947 --> 01:48:10.240
If we start
hunting here...

01:48:10.365 --> 01:48:12.492
the hostiles
will come after us.

01:48:12.659 --> 01:48:13.785
Exactly.

01:48:14.703 --> 01:48:15.412
One hostile...

01:48:15.537 --> 01:48:16.621
in particular.

01:48:26.881 --> 01:48:28.550
I know how you feel.

01:48:31.303 --> 01:48:34.264
I feel all alone too.

01:48:36.224 --> 01:48:37.517
Tell me.

01:48:37.684 --> 01:48:39.311
Why are you outcast?

01:51:02.704 --> 01:51:04.039
I'm sorry.

01:51:04.205 --> 01:51:05.665
I'm so sorry.

01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:10.670
It's okay.

01:51:11.338 --> 01:51:12.130
It's okay.

01:51:26.811 --> 01:51:28.396
You allowed this.

01:51:29.814 --> 01:51:33.193
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast!

01:51:35.946 --> 01:51:36.947
Tsireya.

01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:40.367
You disappoint
me, daughter.

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.911
And you...

01:51:43.078 --> 01:51:44.412
son of a
great warrior...

01:51:44.537 --> 01:51:46.039
who has been
taught better.

01:51:46.206 --> 01:51:47.791
Payakan saved
my life, sir.

01:51:47.958 --> 01:51:48.875
You don't
know him.

01:51:49.042 --> 01:51:50.377
No, Lo'ak.

01:51:51.461 --> 01:51:52.462
Sit.

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.131
Sit.

01:51:58.009 --> 01:51:59.386
Sit down!

01:52:03.473 --> 01:52:04.975
Hear my
words, boy.

01:52:06.893 --> 01:52:09.271
In the days of
the First Songs...

01:52:09.646 --> 01:52:12.065
tulkun fought
amongst themselves...

01:52:12.190 --> 01:52:14.234
for territory...

01:52:14.401 --> 01:52:15.735
and for revenge.

01:52:16.736 --> 01:52:18.613
But they came
to believe...

01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:21.366
that killing, no
matter how justified...

01:52:21.533 --> 01:52:24.202
only brings
more killing.

01:52:26.037 --> 01:52:29.332
So all killing
was forbidden.

01:52:29.499 --> 01:52:32.294
This is the
Tulkun Way.

01:52:33.545 --> 01:52:34.546
Payakan...

01:52:35.422 --> 01:52:37.591
is a killer, so...

01:52:37.591 --> 01:52:39.634
he is outcast.

01:52:39.801 --> 01:52:40.802
I'm sorry, sir.

01:52:40.927 --> 01:52:41.720
But you're wrong.

01:52:41.886 --> 01:52:42.637
Lo'ak.

01:52:43.722 --> 01:52:44.764
You speak
to Olo'eyktan!

01:52:44.931 --> 01:52:45.724
I know
what I...

01:52:45.724 --> 01:52:46.808
That's
enough!

01:52:51.146 --> 01:52:52.230
I know what I know.

01:52:55.734 --> 01:52:56.985
That's enough.

01:52:58.778 --> 01:53:00.530
I'll deal with
this one.

01:53:06.703 --> 01:53:08.163
This storm will pass.

01:53:09.706 --> 01:53:13.752
Lo'ak, I saw
something today.

01:53:13.919 --> 01:53:15.545
I saw a
Forest Boy...

01:53:15.670 --> 01:53:16.963
chosen
by tulkun.

01:53:17.881 --> 01:53:20.425
I am very
proud of you.

01:53:20.592 --> 01:53:22.385
Payakan didn't
kill those boys.

01:53:23.178 --> 01:53:24.179
I saw it all.

01:53:24.346 --> 01:53:27.057
The demon ship killed his
mother right in front of him.

01:53:27.223 --> 01:53:29.267
He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

01:53:29.392 --> 01:53:30.602
to attack the ship.

01:53:31.269 --> 01:53:33.188
And they
were all killed...

01:53:33.647 --> 01:53:35.565
but by the Sky
People. Not by him.

01:53:35.732 --> 01:53:37.567
- He's not a killer.
- No, Lo'ak.

01:53:37.734 --> 01:53:40.070
By the Tulkun
Way, he is.

01:53:40.236 --> 01:53:41.321
He bears
those deaths.

01:53:41.488 --> 01:53:43.865
Does he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

01:53:44.032 --> 01:53:46.409
He knows what he did was wrong.
He would never do it again.

01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:49.245
We must tell
my father...

01:53:49.245 --> 01:53:50.246
No. No.

01:53:50.246 --> 01:53:51.581
I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

01:53:51.748 --> 01:53:52.958
Your father will
understand this.

01:53:53.124 --> 01:53:54.042
No, he won't.

01:53:54.626 --> 01:53:56.544
He doesn't
understand anything.

01:53:56.711 --> 01:53:58.338
The whole clan
hates me.

01:53:58.505 --> 01:53:59.714
Demon
blood.

01:53:59.881 --> 01:54:01.716
Alien.
That's all they see.

01:54:07.973 --> 01:54:09.724
I See you.

01:54:13.979 --> 01:54:16.564
You are
Brother of Tulkun.

01:54:18.817 --> 01:54:20.777
You are one
of us now.

01:54:37.961 --> 01:54:38.962
You got my mother?

01:54:39.129 --> 01:54:41.923
Mother and calf. Strong
signal. Range 4,000.

01:54:42.090 --> 01:54:42.882
Bring it down...

01:54:43.008 --> 01:54:43.717
on the hull.

01:54:43.883 --> 01:54:45.343
Comin'
down, aye.

01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:46.511
Foils deployed.

01:55:08.825 --> 01:55:09.618
Sub teams...

01:55:09.743 --> 01:55:10.410
two minutes!

01:55:10.410 --> 01:55:11.995
Let's get in there!

01:55:12.162 --> 01:55:14.164
Hatches closed!

01:55:14.331 --> 01:55:15.206
Come on,
hustle!

01:55:15.332 --> 01:55:16.249
Hustle!

01:55:16.416 --> 01:55:18.293
Crews to their boats.
Two minutes.

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:19.711
Let's make
some bank.

01:55:20.879 --> 01:55:22.172
Boat crews!

01:55:22.339 --> 01:55:24.925
Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

01:55:30.221 --> 01:55:32.057
All boats in! Boats in!

01:55:36.686 --> 01:55:38.146
Let's go,
baby!

01:55:49.032 --> 01:55:50.241
We're rollin'!

01:56:16.601 --> 01:56:18.061
Stand by
depth charges...

01:56:18.228 --> 01:56:20.230
and fire, fire, fire!

01:56:42.627 --> 01:56:43.503
What's that?

01:56:43.503 --> 01:56:44.504
What are
they doin'?

01:56:45.797 --> 01:56:47.507
Those are
echolocation sensors.

01:56:47.674 --> 01:56:49.009
How they navigate.

01:56:49.175 --> 01:56:50.176
They have to hold...

01:56:50.302 --> 01:56:50.927
them out
of the water...

01:56:51.094 --> 01:56:52.178
or they'll
go deaf.

01:56:53.179 --> 01:56:54.180
Picadors!

01:56:54.556 --> 01:56:55.265
Get in there!

01:56:55.265 --> 01:56:55.974
Go on.

01:56:55.974 --> 01:56:56.683
Get in there.

01:56:56.683 --> 01:56:57.726
Get up in there!

01:57:13.742 --> 01:57:15.994
They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod...

01:57:16.161 --> 01:57:17.829
using the
sound cannon.

01:57:17.996 --> 01:57:19.914
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly...

01:57:20.123 --> 01:57:23.001
and she won't
leave the calf.

01:57:23.418 --> 01:57:25.045
Do they ever
fight back?

01:57:25.211 --> 01:57:27.589
Nah, never seen
'em lift a fin.

01:57:28.214 --> 01:57:30.133
Tough bastards
to kill though.

01:57:31.426 --> 01:57:33.011
Sub teams, go!

01:57:33.553 --> 01:57:34.387
And release.

01:57:38.558 --> 01:57:40.268
Release, release.

01:57:45.065 --> 01:57:46.066
There's
our gal.

01:57:46.232 --> 01:57:47.233
Target
in sight.

01:57:47.734 --> 01:57:49.194
3-6 is in hot
with harpoons.

01:57:49.361 --> 01:57:50.528
Here we go, baby.

01:57:51.988 --> 01:57:53.949
See, we go
in from below...

01:57:54.074 --> 01:57:55.909
where there's
gaps in the armor.

01:57:59.788 --> 01:58:01.373
All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

01:58:01.539 --> 01:58:02.540
I'm
goin' in.

01:58:02.707 --> 01:58:04.000
Get me
in close.

01:58:07.545 --> 01:58:08.546
Hold her steady.

01:58:08.713 --> 01:58:10.257
In range.
Arm one.

01:58:10.423 --> 01:58:12.092
Arming,
target lock.

01:58:12.259 --> 01:58:13.385
And
one away.

01:58:19.724 --> 01:58:21.142
Two's in hot.

01:58:21.309 --> 01:58:22.310
- Arm one.
- Arming.

01:58:22.477 --> 01:58:23.520
Fire.

01:58:27.691 --> 01:58:28.650
Good strike.
Arm two.

01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:29.359
Arming.

01:58:29.359 --> 01:58:30.485
Two away.

01:58:31.778 --> 01:58:32.779
Booyah!

01:58:32.946 --> 01:58:33.863
Nice.

01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:35.657
3-6, you owe
us a beer.

01:58:40.453 --> 01:58:42.497
You see, the bags
slow her down...

01:58:42.622 --> 01:58:43.873
and keep her up
at the surface.

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.041
Yeah.

01:58:45.208 --> 01:58:46.334
Get on her!

01:58:46.501 --> 01:58:47.794
Get me in there.

01:58:47.961 --> 01:58:49.337
Straight up on her.

01:58:49.588 --> 01:58:50.589
30 meters.

01:58:51.464 --> 01:58:53.049
Explosive-tipped
harpoon.

01:58:53.592 --> 01:58:56.261
Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

01:58:56.761 --> 01:58:57.929
Now steady, steady.

01:58:57.929 --> 01:58:59.055
Stay
with her.

01:58:59.389 --> 01:59:00.974
Hold. Hold.

01:59:03.143 --> 01:59:04.352
Line's runnin'!

01:59:11.192 --> 01:59:13.320
Hold on to your
ponytail, Colonel!

01:59:24.247 --> 01:59:25.332
Hold back full!

01:59:25.498 --> 01:59:26.833
Back full, aye.

01:59:33.506 --> 01:59:34.674
Hold her.

01:59:34.841 --> 01:59:35.967
Hold her.

01:59:39.262 --> 01:59:41.932
She takes an explosive
harpoon to the chest...

01:59:42.057 --> 01:59:43.475
and she's
still runnin'.

01:59:44.392 --> 01:59:46.019
Beautiful.

02:00:59.884 --> 02:01:02.679
The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

02:01:02.846 --> 02:01:05.056
We drill up through
the hard palate...

02:01:05.974 --> 02:01:07.976
into the brain. And...

02:01:11.771 --> 02:01:14.024
These are highly
intelligent beings.

02:01:14.190 --> 02:01:15.150
Probably smarter
than us.

02:01:15.317 --> 02:01:16.568
Not smarter than me.

02:01:16.735 --> 02:01:18.194
That is setting
the bar very low.

02:01:18.361 --> 02:01:19.904
Hey, I'm the one
with the harpoon.

02:01:21.489 --> 02:01:22.490
Yep.

02:01:33.585 --> 02:01:34.586
How do
you know?

02:01:34.753 --> 02:01:36.004
That they're
smarter than us?

02:01:36.838 --> 02:01:38.506
More neurons, more pathways.

02:01:39.382 --> 02:01:41.551
Not only are they
smarter, they're...

02:01:41.676 --> 02:01:42.928
deeply
emotional.

02:01:43.845 --> 02:01:45.096
More spiritual.

02:01:49.434 --> 02:01:52.354
See, this region here corresponds
with our emotional centers...

02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:54.981
but proportionally
it's much larger.

02:01:56.358 --> 02:01:57.901
They have music...

02:01:58.068 --> 02:01:59.611
philosophy...

02:01:59.778 --> 02:02:01.363
mathematics...

02:02:01.863 --> 02:02:03.198
complex language.

02:02:03.782 --> 02:02:04.407
Okay.

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:06.326
Here we go.

02:02:07.118 --> 02:02:08.495
Show me
the money.

02:02:13.208 --> 02:02:15.210
So that's what this is all about?

02:02:15.835 --> 02:02:17.170
That's it.

02:02:17.337 --> 02:02:18.338
Amrita.

02:02:21.258 --> 02:02:23.176
Bad luck for the big guys.

02:02:23.343 --> 02:02:26.596
This stuff just happens to
stop human aging. Like...

02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:28.556
stops it.

02:02:31.059 --> 02:02:33.270
Ounce for ounce the
single most valuable...

02:02:33.395 --> 02:02:35.355
substance known to man.

02:02:37.065 --> 02:02:39.067
This little vial
here is worth like...

02:02:40.235 --> 02:02:41.486
80 million.

02:02:42.529 --> 02:02:43.405
Think fast!

02:02:44.739 --> 02:02:45.907
Please don't.

02:02:47.158 --> 02:02:48.034
It's never funny.

02:02:49.077 --> 02:02:52.247
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

02:02:53.206 --> 02:02:55.625
Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

02:02:55.792 --> 02:02:57.085
It's why I drink.

02:02:59.504 --> 02:03:00.589
That's all you take?

02:03:01.881 --> 02:03:03.925
I mean, you just
waste the rest?

02:03:05.468 --> 02:03:07.053
Drop the bags.

02:03:07.637 --> 02:03:08.805
Let's sink her!

02:03:08.972 --> 02:03:11.057
No. Leave
the bags.

02:03:11.433 --> 02:03:13.226
I want 'em to know it was us.

02:03:13.893 --> 02:03:17.272
I charge extra for
bein' used as bait.

02:03:51.556 --> 02:03:54.059
Her name is Ro'a.

02:03:56.436 --> 02:03:59.272
She was my Spirit Sister.

02:04:01.650 --> 02:04:04.402
She was a
composer of songs.

02:04:04.569 --> 02:04:05.862
Much revered.

02:04:06.029 --> 02:04:07.280
We would
sing together.

02:04:08.949 --> 02:04:12.619
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

02:04:13.119 --> 02:04:15.372
The clan were
so happy for her.

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.418
What is this, Tonowari?

02:04:23.171 --> 02:04:24.839
What is this?

02:04:44.401 --> 02:04:47.320
My Spirit Sister
and her baby...

02:04:47.487 --> 02:04:50.031
have been murdered
by the Sky People!

02:04:51.366 --> 02:04:53.576
This war has come to us.

02:04:54.411 --> 02:04:55.954
We knew
about this hunting...

02:04:56.079 --> 02:04:57.831
of our
tulkun people.

02:04:57.998 --> 02:04:59.374
But it was
over the horizon...

02:04:59.791 --> 02:05:00.917
far away.

02:05:01.084 --> 02:05:02.877
Now it
is here!

02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:07.632
No, you don't...

02:05:07.799 --> 02:05:09.926
You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.

02:05:10.093 --> 02:05:11.803
They don't care
about the Great Balance.

02:05:11.970 --> 02:05:13.513
We don't answer
to Sky People!

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:15.515
Listen. Listen to him.

02:05:15.682 --> 02:05:16.808
The Sky People
are not gonna stop.

02:05:16.975 --> 02:05:17.892
This is only
the beginning.

02:05:18.059 --> 02:05:20.103
You gotta tell
your tulkun to leave.

02:05:21.271 --> 02:05:23.273
You gotta tell them
to go far away!

02:05:23.607 --> 02:05:24.357
Leave?

02:05:26.026 --> 02:05:27.235
You live
among us...

02:05:28.361 --> 02:05:30.155
and you
learn nothing!

02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:33.450
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

02:05:33.617 --> 02:05:34.784
No, no, no.

02:05:36.411 --> 02:05:37.495
If you attack...

02:05:37.662 --> 02:05:39.372
if you fight...

02:05:39.539 --> 02:05:40.874
then they will
destroy you!

02:05:41.041 --> 02:05:41.833
They will destroy...

02:05:41.958 --> 02:05:43.001
everything
that you love.

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:44.628
No!

02:05:44.753 --> 02:05:45.921
You hear
my words!

02:05:46.546 --> 02:05:47.547
Hear my words!

02:05:47.714 --> 02:05:48.715
Stay calm.

02:05:48.882 --> 02:05:49.716
Stay calm!

02:05:50.425 --> 02:05:51.426
Listen to my father.

02:05:51.593 --> 02:05:52.427
Damn it!

02:05:52.594 --> 02:05:53.845
He speaks the truth.

02:06:03.855 --> 02:06:05.190
You tell the tulkun...

02:06:06.983 --> 02:06:08.443
that if they're hit
by one of these...

02:06:08.568 --> 02:06:09.736
they're marked for death.

02:06:12.822 --> 02:06:13.698
And call for me...

02:06:13.823 --> 02:06:15.033
I'll silence it.

02:06:17.702 --> 02:06:19.621
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

02:06:20.664 --> 02:06:21.998
Right?

02:06:24.501 --> 02:06:26.211
Saving your family.

02:06:39.057 --> 02:06:40.267
Tell the tulkun.

02:06:41.559 --> 02:06:42.560
Go.

02:06:42.978 --> 02:06:44.062
Go!

02:06:47.691 --> 02:06:49.359
We must fight.

02:06:50.485 --> 02:06:52.070
MaJake.

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:53.822
I will not stand and
do nothing!

02:06:54.656 --> 02:06:56.866
It's a trap. They
want us to hit back.

02:06:57.617 --> 02:06:59.202
They're not hunting tulkun.

02:06:59.369 --> 02:07:00.870
They're hunting us.

02:07:15.427 --> 02:07:17.345
No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

02:07:17.512 --> 02:07:19.097
I have to warn Payakan
about the pingers.

02:07:19.764 --> 02:07:20.473
No.

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:22.559
You've gotta keep
your skxawng ass here.

02:07:22.726 --> 02:07:23.768
He's outcast.

02:07:23.935 --> 02:07:25.687
There's nobody
to warn him but me.

02:07:25.854 --> 02:07:26.646
Bro...

02:07:27.897 --> 02:07:29.941
why do you always have
to make things so hard?

02:07:31.526 --> 02:07:32.569
No.

02:07:32.736 --> 02:07:35.322
You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

02:07:36.698 --> 02:07:38.158
The perfect
little soldier.

02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:40.201
Well,
I'm not you!

02:07:40.869 --> 02:07:41.703
Okay?

02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:43.121
I'm not you.

02:07:44.539 --> 02:07:45.874
He's my brother.

02:07:46.041 --> 02:07:47.083
I'm going.

02:07:47.250 --> 02:07:48.627
He's your
brother?

02:07:49.794 --> 02:07:51.713
No, I'm
your brother.

02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:52.714
Lo'ak!

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.382
Get off me.

02:07:55.592 --> 02:07:56.426
Lo'ak!

02:07:56.593 --> 02:07:57.260
Come back!

02:07:57.385 --> 02:07:58.011
Come on.

02:07:58.136 --> 02:07:59.179
He's going to Payakan.

02:08:11.274 --> 02:08:12.400
Come back!

02:08:13.568 --> 02:08:15.028
There's
Lo'ak! Lo'ak.

02:08:15.403 --> 02:08:16.446
Lo'ak!

02:08:16.613 --> 02:08:18.156
Lo'ak's going
to find Payakan!

02:08:18.615 --> 02:08:19.449
Wait up!

02:08:21.117 --> 02:08:21.868
Hold on!

02:08:31.211 --> 02:08:32.963
- All crews to stations.
- Sound general call.

02:08:33.129 --> 02:08:35.298
All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

02:08:44.182 --> 02:08:45.183
Brother!

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:46.226
Lo'ak!

02:08:48.728 --> 02:08:49.354
Lo'ak!

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:50.063
Wait!

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:54.651
What is it?
What's wrong?

02:08:56.653 --> 02:08:57.821
Shit!

02:08:58.488 --> 02:09:00.407
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

02:09:01.157 --> 02:09:02.409
I got this.

02:09:08.873 --> 02:09:09.833
Shit!

02:09:14.045 --> 02:09:15.213
Bro, come on!
Help me out!

02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:16.840
Hurry, the
ship's coming!

02:09:16.965 --> 02:09:17.799
They're over there!

02:09:20.218 --> 02:09:21.469
Bro, come on!

02:09:22.429 --> 02:09:23.722
Bro.

02:09:23.888 --> 02:09:24.598
Come on, bro.

02:09:24.723 --> 02:09:25.348
Hurry!

02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:26.766
Call it in!

02:09:26.891 --> 02:09:27.809
Call Dad!

02:09:28.351 --> 02:09:29.519
Call Dad!
Just go! Do it!

02:09:29.686 --> 02:09:30.770
Just do it.

02:09:31.605 --> 02:09:33.565
Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:34.899
Did you see
where they went?

02:09:35.025 --> 02:09:35.942
It's Eagle Eye,
do you copy?

02:09:36.067 --> 02:09:37.485
- They went outside the reef.
- Yeah, Lo'ak.

02:09:37.652 --> 02:09:38.278
Dad!

02:09:39.738 --> 02:09:42.032
We're with a tulkun
that's under attack.

02:09:42.198 --> 02:09:43.283
Killer ship's inbound.

02:09:43.450 --> 02:09:44.826
It's about
two klicks out.

02:09:45.452 --> 02:09:46.119
Who's with you?

02:09:46.119 --> 02:09:46.828
It's all of us.

02:09:47.037 --> 02:09:48.371
Aonung and Tsireya too.

02:09:48.538 --> 02:09:49.914
We're at
Three Brothers Rocks.

02:09:50.081 --> 02:09:51.958
You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

02:09:52.125 --> 02:09:53.001
All right? You hear me?

02:09:53.168 --> 02:09:54.210
Do not engage.
We're comin'.

02:09:54.377 --> 02:09:55.211
Yes, sir.

02:09:55.378 --> 02:09:56.504
It's getting closer!

02:09:56.630 --> 02:09:58.757
- Three, two, pull!
- Pull!

02:09:59.716 --> 02:10:01.092
Kids are under attack!

02:10:01.635 --> 02:10:03.553
The kids are under attack.
They were defending a tulkun.

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:04.971
It's your kids too.

02:10:05.138 --> 02:10:06.181
The demon ship?

02:10:06.348 --> 02:10:06.973
Yes!

02:10:06.973 --> 02:10:07.682
We gotta go!

02:10:07.807 --> 02:10:09.517
Weapons.
Sound the alarm!

02:10:13.730 --> 02:10:14.814
You should stay back.

02:10:15.148 --> 02:10:16.024
I ride!

02:10:16.358 --> 02:10:16.983
Come!

02:11:06.449 --> 02:11:08.285
Sub teams, hatches close.

02:11:08.451 --> 02:11:09.911
Two-minute warning.

02:11:16.876 --> 02:11:17.877
Aonung!

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:19.879
Hurry up! Come on!

02:11:20.046 --> 02:11:21.214
Bro, hurry up!

02:11:23.675 --> 02:11:24.426
Go, go, go!

02:11:28.597 --> 02:11:29.764
Pull! Now!

02:11:31.725 --> 02:11:33.435
- Everybody! Together!
- Pull!

02:11:37.272 --> 02:11:38.648
I'll be damned.

02:11:39.899 --> 02:11:41.109
Sully's kids.

02:11:41.568 --> 02:11:43.236
Let's roll.
Not you.

02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:44.821
Saddle up.

02:11:56.583 --> 02:11:58.209
Range is 700 meters.

02:11:58.376 --> 02:11:59.961
Pinger signal is good.

02:12:01.838 --> 02:12:03.214
Pull, harder!

02:12:03.381 --> 02:12:04.591
Pull!

02:12:05.342 --> 02:12:06.676
Pull, harder!

02:12:06.843 --> 02:12:07.802
Go!

02:12:08.261 --> 02:12:09.888
It's out!
Kiri, it's out!

02:12:10.013 --> 02:12:11.014
Go.
Tuk, go.

02:12:11.473 --> 02:12:13.141
Come on. Get out of here!

02:12:13.308 --> 02:12:14.309
Go that way!

02:12:14.434 --> 02:12:15.060
I'll draw
them off.

02:12:15.185 --> 02:12:16.519
- Okay.
- Lo'ak, come.

02:12:18.188 --> 02:12:19.564
Go, go, dive!

02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:21.149
Now, dive!

02:12:21.274 --> 02:12:21.942
Grab on.

02:12:31.952 --> 02:12:33.036
Range 300.

02:12:33.203 --> 02:12:34.913
Ready depth charges...

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.415
and fire, fire, fire.

02:12:43.338 --> 02:12:44.714
No depth charges.

02:12:44.839 --> 02:12:46.091
Scoresby,
you copy?

02:12:46.216 --> 02:12:47.842
These kids are
worthless to me dead.

02:12:48.426 --> 02:12:49.844
Hold your fire.

02:12:54.432 --> 02:12:57.185
Circle out. Get a cordon around 'em.

02:12:57.352 --> 02:12:58.687
Get your subs in the water.

02:12:59.604 --> 02:13:01.523
Sub teams, get wet.

02:13:51.072 --> 02:13:53.074
Crabs flank right.
Get around on 'em.

02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:58.163
Don't lose 'em.
Stay on 'em now.

02:13:58.663 --> 02:13:59.748
Planes up. We're goin' in!

02:13:59.914 --> 02:14:01.207
Oh, hell yeah!

02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:34.783
Tone on lock.
Two away.

02:15:04.396 --> 02:15:05.355
Where is Tuk?

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:06.314
Did you see her?

02:15:22.998 --> 02:15:23.999
Tuk!

02:15:26.626 --> 02:15:27.544
Target in sight.

02:15:32.132 --> 02:15:33.341
It is coming.

02:15:33.508 --> 02:15:34.801
We gotta go!

02:15:51.192 --> 02:15:52.235
- Switch net.
- Switching.

02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:53.111
Fire.

02:16:13.590 --> 02:16:14.341
Hold on!

02:16:14.716 --> 02:16:15.592
Let me out!

02:16:16.217 --> 02:16:17.218
- Watch out!
- Tuk, move!

02:16:17.385 --> 02:16:18.303
Move your hand! Move your hand!

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:20.221
- Cut it!
- Hurry, hurry!

02:16:24.684 --> 02:16:26.269
Hey, kid, get back here!

02:16:32.025 --> 02:16:32.650
Drop the weapon.

02:16:32.775 --> 02:16:33.651
- Put the weapon down!
- Put it down.

02:16:34.110 --> 02:16:34.944
Put it down!

02:16:37.155 --> 02:16:37.864
Stay down.

02:16:38.782 --> 02:16:40.658
- Hey, kid, get back here!
- Get him! Get him!

02:16:40.908 --> 02:16:42.159
Put the weapon down!

02:16:42.577 --> 02:16:43.495
Drop it, now!

02:16:43.703 --> 02:16:45.079
- Put it down!
- Drop the knife.

02:16:45.246 --> 02:16:46.247
Drop it.

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:48.749
Hey! Hey, what are
you doing? Stop!

02:16:48.917 --> 02:16:50.042
Stop.
Don't hurt them.

02:16:51.628 --> 02:16:52.295
Stop moving.

02:16:52.504 --> 02:16:54.506
-Spider!
- Bro, you okay?

02:16:55.006 --> 02:16:56.257
Yeah. Great, cuz.

02:16:56.424 --> 02:16:57.467
Never better.

02:17:00.302 --> 02:17:01.304
Knock it off.
Stay still.

02:17:04.266 --> 02:17:05.266
Get back
to the bridge.

02:17:06.892 --> 02:17:07.894
Keep him there!

02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:09.479
I'm going,
I'm going.

02:17:10.647 --> 02:17:11.773
Yeah.

02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:13.066
I remember you.

02:17:14.234 --> 02:17:15.860
Cuff 'em to the
rail. All of 'em.

02:17:15.986 --> 02:17:16.694
Let's go.

02:17:17.654 --> 02:17:18.905
Let's go. Move!

02:17:18.905 --> 02:17:19.698
Over here.

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:20.782
Watch 'em.
They bite.

02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:22.617
Get on your knees.

02:17:22.617 --> 02:17:23.326
On 'em.

02:17:23.326 --> 02:17:24.034
Give me your hand.

02:17:24.034 --> 02:17:24.785
No!

02:17:26.078 --> 02:17:26.704
Now the other.

02:17:26.829 --> 02:17:27.831
No.

02:17:31.792 --> 02:17:32.793
Be brave.

02:17:37.465 --> 02:17:38.550
Na'vi inbound!

02:17:41.011 --> 02:17:42.012
Spread out.
Weapons up.

02:17:42.012 --> 02:17:42.721
Dad!

02:17:42.846 --> 02:17:44.431
Push left.
Spread out.

02:17:46.850 --> 02:17:47.851
Stop.
Stop them.

02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:53.315
It's Sully.

02:17:55.567 --> 02:17:56.568
300 yards.

02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:03.908
They got our kids.

02:18:04.075 --> 02:18:05.368
Your daughter.

02:18:05.534 --> 02:18:06.535
Tuk. Lo'ak.

02:18:09.539 --> 02:18:10.165
Jake...

02:18:10.748 --> 02:18:12.876
tell your friends
to stand down.

02:18:14.002 --> 02:18:15.962
You want your kids back...

02:18:16.129 --> 02:18:17.672
you come out alone.

02:18:20.467 --> 02:18:22.594
You know better
than to test my resolve.

02:18:23.929 --> 02:18:25.055
Lo'ak!
No!

02:18:28.141 --> 02:18:30.101
I took you under my wing, Jake.

02:18:30.644 --> 02:18:32.561
You betrayed me.

02:18:32.729 --> 02:18:34.105
You killed your own.

02:18:34.272 --> 02:18:36.106
Good men.
Good women.

02:18:36.274 --> 02:18:39.361
I will not hesitate
to execute your kid.

02:18:40.862 --> 02:18:41.863
Just wait one.

02:18:53.208 --> 02:18:54.334
Hold here.

02:18:55.335 --> 02:18:57.212
They are
killers of tulkun.

02:18:57.837 --> 02:18:59.047
They must die.

02:18:59.213 --> 02:19:01.007
Here. Today.

02:19:01.174 --> 02:19:02.801
It's me that they want.

02:19:02.968 --> 02:19:04.469
That's what all this
has been about, all right?

02:19:04.636 --> 02:19:07.055
The hunting of our tulkun.
The taking of our kids.

02:19:10.183 --> 02:19:12.102
You brought
this upon us!

02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:13.645
You!

02:19:17.481 --> 02:19:19.234
Well, then it's me
that has to do this.

02:19:25.489 --> 02:19:27.325
Offer's fixin' to expire.

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:29.034
What's it gonna be?

02:19:29.785 --> 02:19:31.246
Check your fire.

02:19:31.413 --> 02:19:32.579
I'm comin' out.

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:44.383
MaJake...

02:19:44.508 --> 02:19:45.301
what is happening?

02:19:46.219 --> 02:19:47.304
MaJake?

02:19:49.973 --> 02:19:52.684
Stay tense everybody.
All weapons.

02:20:10.035 --> 02:20:11.620
Easy shot.

02:20:12.203 --> 02:20:14.289
You hit him
now, they attack.

02:20:15.582 --> 02:20:17.542
Wait till
he's on board.

02:20:44.361 --> 02:20:45.737
Payakan!

02:20:57.415 --> 02:20:58.375
Open fire.
Open fire!

02:21:00.961 --> 02:21:01.711
Brother!

02:21:06.716 --> 02:21:08.343
- Come about!
- Comin' about!

02:21:08.468 --> 02:21:09.803
Get me around!

02:21:10.595 --> 02:21:11.429
Get me a shot!

02:21:12.555 --> 02:21:14.391
Go, go!

02:21:33.076 --> 02:21:34.202
Get me around!

02:21:34.369 --> 02:21:35.787
Go, go, go!

02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:38.206
Get in there...

02:21:38.373 --> 02:21:40.208
get me in range.
Go, go, go.

02:21:49.342 --> 02:21:50.051
Down!

02:21:53.430 --> 02:21:54.931
Bloody hell!

02:21:59.102 --> 02:21:59.894
Open fire!

02:22:00.729 --> 02:22:01.521
Open fire!

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.027
Sully's inbound.

02:22:07.193 --> 02:22:08.403
I want eyes on!

02:22:08.695 --> 02:22:10.614
All right, let's go.
Saddle up. We're up!

02:22:52.572 --> 02:22:54.658
Somebody
shoot something!

02:23:10.382 --> 02:23:11.007
Stop!

02:24:06.813 --> 02:24:08.064
Get after them. Go!

02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:27.208
Breach!
Masks on!

02:24:27.542 --> 02:24:28.960
Masks
on! Go!

02:25:08.708 --> 02:25:10.043
Get him
out of here!

02:25:15.090 --> 02:25:16.091
Calm down!

02:25:30.313 --> 02:25:31.439
Go, go, go!

02:25:44.995 --> 02:25:46.246
Damage report!

02:25:46.413 --> 02:25:47.163
Flooding.

02:25:47.289 --> 02:25:48.206
Compartment
two and three.

02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:49.541
You okay?

02:26:19.279 --> 02:26:20.280
Port bow!

02:26:21.406 --> 02:26:22.490
Hard port!

02:26:22.616 --> 02:26:23.283
Open fire!

02:26:24.326 --> 02:26:25.535
Get me a shot!

02:26:26.578 --> 02:26:27.245
Got ya!

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:46.681
Cut us away!

02:26:46.848 --> 02:26:47.933
Not responding!

02:26:48.308 --> 02:26:50.101
Get us off the cable!

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:52.187
Who's got the
harpoon now?

02:26:56.650 --> 02:26:57.859
Back full!

02:27:09.454 --> 02:27:10.580
Reload!

02:27:13.833 --> 02:27:15.669
Not the cable,
you idiot!

02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:18.129
We're dead
in the water.

02:27:19.464 --> 02:27:21.049
Taking on water. Pumps on.

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:23.093
Man your
weapons!

02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:25.637
I thought you were the
intelligent species here, Scoresby.

Shut ya cakehole, Garvin.

02:27:29.516 --> 02:27:30.725
Where are you?

02:27:31.393 --> 02:27:32.727
Cheeky bugger.

02:27:32.894 --> 02:27:34.813
You think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

02:27:50.078 --> 02:27:51.162
Get down!

02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:04.301
Pumps aren't working.

02:28:04.467 --> 02:28:05.260
Abandon ship!

02:28:05.385 --> 02:28:06.261
Abandon ship!

02:28:06.428 --> 02:28:07.721
- Get him to a boat!
- All crew to the boats.

02:28:07.887 --> 02:28:09.764
Let's go, people!
Let's move! Mask up!

02:28:15.228 --> 02:28:16.521
Neteyam!

02:28:17.063 --> 02:28:18.148
Hey,
baby brother.

02:28:18.315 --> 02:28:19.399
Need some help?

02:28:19.899 --> 02:28:20.942
Shut up. Come on.

02:28:21.067 --> 02:28:21.860
Get us loose.

02:28:24.946 --> 02:28:27.115
- Okay, get Tuk out of here.
- Bro, hurry up!

02:28:28.908 --> 02:28:30.493
Who's the Mighty Warrior?
Come on.

02:28:30.619 --> 02:28:31.411
Say it.

02:28:32.037 --> 02:28:33.413
- Bro!
- Come on. Let's go.

02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:36.249
Lo'ak!

02:28:37.125 --> 02:28:38.126
They've
got Spider.

02:28:38.293 --> 02:28:40.003
We've gotta get him.
Come on.

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:41.379
Come on, bro.

02:28:41.588 --> 02:28:42.797
We can't
leave him.

02:28:50.931 --> 02:28:51.973
Let me go!

02:28:54.184 --> 02:28:55.393
No!

02:28:57.562 --> 02:28:58.396
Look!

02:29:05.236 --> 02:29:06.905
Let's go, buttercup.
Get up.

02:29:07.072 --> 02:29:09.240
I'm not your
buttercup, perv!

02:29:09.407 --> 02:29:10.659
We've got to go
back for her.

02:29:11.785 --> 02:29:12.786
Tuk, wait!

02:29:12.953 --> 02:29:14.496
Sullys
stick together.

02:29:26.216 --> 02:29:27.759
Wait right there, guys. Wait.

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:29.844
Clear to drop!

02:29:31.221 --> 02:29:32.472
Check your mask.
Make sure it's tight.

02:29:32.639 --> 02:29:33.765
I'm good, dumbass.

02:29:36.935 --> 02:29:37.936
Move, move!

02:29:38.103 --> 02:29:39.271
Evacuating, people.

02:29:43.525 --> 02:29:44.276
Tuk...

02:29:44.526 --> 02:29:46.069
this is not a good idea.

02:29:46.236 --> 02:29:47.195
Tuk!

02:30:07.465 --> 02:30:08.341
Cut it here.

02:30:11.595 --> 02:30:12.220
No!

02:30:18.602 --> 02:30:19.603
I got her.

02:30:26.234 --> 02:30:27.402
We can still
get this done.

02:30:27.569 --> 02:30:28.528
Hell yeah.

02:30:29.404 --> 02:30:31.865
I can't believe
I'm tied up again!

02:30:58.058 --> 02:30:59.017
Bro, come on.

02:30:59.142 --> 02:30:59.768
Let's go.

02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:04.314
Thanks, guys.

02:31:06.942 --> 02:31:07.567

02:31:07.692 --> 02:31:08.360

02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:12.197

02:31:19.996 --> 02:31:21.081
Go, go, go!

02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:22.791
This way.

02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:31.341

Hold him up!

I can't go back.

02:32:42.537 --> 02:32:43.538

02:32:44.414 --> 02:32:45.749
Dad, help!

02:32:52.422 --> 02:32:53.632

02:33:06.478 --> 02:33:07.812
Just watch his head.

02:33:08.396 --> 02:33:09.022
Okay.

02:33:10.065 --> 02:33:10.815
It's okay, bro.

02:33:10.941 --> 02:33:11.608
We got you.

02:33:12.359 --> 02:33:13.109
Oh, no.

02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:16.279
Put pressure.

02:33:16.404 --> 02:33:17.197
Put pressure
on it.

02:33:19.324 --> 02:33:20.450
Dad, I...

02:33:20.575 --> 02:33:21.451
It's okay.
I'm here.

02:33:23.954 --> 02:33:25.205
No, no, no.

02:33:25.372 --> 02:33:26.414
It's okay, son.
I gotcha.

02:33:32.337 --> 02:33:33.338
I want to go home.

I know. I know.

02:33:37.467 --> 02:33:38.385
It's okay, we're goin' home.

02:33:39.094 --> 02:33:40.178
We're goin' home.

02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:44.891
It's okay. It's okay.

02:33:45.058 --> 02:33:46.059
Dad, I...

02:33:53.149 --> 02:33:54.150
Neteyam...

02:33:59.364 --> 02:34:03.368
No. No, no, no.
Neteyam!

02:34:11.084 --> 02:34:12.586
Oh, Great Mother.

02:34:12.752 --> 02:34:13.837
No, Great Mother.

02:34:14.671 --> 02:34:16.256
Please.

02:34:17.841 --> 02:34:19.301
Oh, my son.

02:34:19.426 --> 02:34:20.927
My son.

02:34:21.052 --> 02:34:22.012
No!

02:34:27.934 --> 02:34:29.436
My son!

02:34:32.939 --> 02:34:34.357
No!

02:34:36.109 --> 02:34:37.694
No!

02:34:38.361 --> 02:34:40.572
Can you hear
me, Corporal?

02:34:42.741 --> 02:34:45.452
Yeah, yeah,
I think you can.

02:34:46.411 --> 02:34:47.662
I got your daughters.

02:34:50.373 --> 02:34:51.791
Same deal as before.

02:34:53.418 --> 02:34:54.419
You for them.

02:34:55.629 --> 02:34:57.380
No!

02:34:59.758 --> 02:35:01.217
Where are your sisters?

02:35:03.178 --> 02:35:04.679
Your sisters.
Where are they?

02:35:05.597 --> 02:35:06.598
I don't know.

02:35:06.765 --> 02:35:07.933
- Where are they?
- They're on the ship.

02:35:08.099 --> 02:35:09.893
They're tied up on the ship.

02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:11.269
They're at the moon pool.

02:35:11.895 --> 02:35:14.022
At the well deck. Midships.

02:35:14.147 --> 02:35:15.023
What?

02:35:15.482 --> 02:35:16.650
Come on. I'll show you.

02:35:17.275 --> 02:35:18.193
Come on.

02:35:18.193 --> 02:35:18.902
I'll show you.

02:35:18.902 --> 02:35:20.320
Talk to me, Corporal.

02:35:20.487 --> 02:35:22.030
- Z, up top.
- I need somethin', Jake...

02:35:22.197 --> 02:35:23.740
or there's gonna
be consequences.

02:35:24.741 --> 02:35:25.742
Yeah, I hear you.

02:35:26.868 --> 02:35:27.869
- Come on.
- Come on!

02:35:28.036 --> 02:35:30.288
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on, let's go.

02:35:30.664 --> 02:35:31.998
- No!
- Let's go.

02:35:32.165 --> 02:35:34.960
Listen. Listen. Listen to me.

02:35:37.963 --> 02:35:38.755
Listen to me. Listen to me.

02:35:38.755 --> 02:35:40.090
They have our daughters.

02:35:40.257 --> 02:35:41.508
They have our daughters.

02:35:44.761 --> 02:35:46.972
I need you
with me.

02:35:48.181 --> 02:35:49.724
And I need you
to be strong.

02:35:50.267 --> 02:35:51.685
Right now.

02:35:51.851 --> 02:35:53.061
Strong heart.

02:35:54.479 --> 02:35:55.730
Strong heart.

02:36:09.369 --> 02:36:10.704
Let's go get our daughters.

02:36:25.677 --> 02:36:27.178
You stay with your brother.

02:36:27.721 --> 02:36:29.139
Dad, I want
to go with you.

02:36:32.142 --> 02:36:33.143
You've done enough.

02:36:33.310 --> 02:36:34.352
Dad...

02:36:39.149 --> 02:36:40.150
Hold fire.

02:36:41.443 --> 02:36:42.444
Let's go.

02:36:43.486 --> 02:36:44.487
He's coming.

02:36:46.364 --> 02:36:47.282
I'm good. Go, go!

02:36:49.743 --> 02:36:50.869
Let's get
this guy.

02:36:50.994 --> 02:36:52.203
It's what we
came here for.

02:36:57.417 --> 02:36:58.418
Stay with him.

02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:00.045
No...

02:37:00.879 --> 02:37:02.213
Heads on a swivel, guys.

02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:24.235
Go.

02:37:32.702 --> 02:37:33.703
Where are they?

02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:34.579
The middle deck.

02:37:34.704 --> 02:37:35.622
Where they
launch the subs.

02:37:35.789 --> 02:37:37.207
There's, like,
a pool in the center.

02:37:38.166 --> 02:37:39.292
They're at the forward railing.

02:37:41.878 --> 02:37:42.879
No, no.
Stay here.

02:37:46.049 --> 02:37:47.217
Talk to me, Corporal.

02:37:48.176 --> 02:37:49.261
This ship's
going down...

02:37:49.427 --> 02:37:50.595
and your girls with it.

02:37:52.347 --> 02:37:53.932
Your boy
didn't have to die.

02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:56.017
You brought
that on yourself.

02:38:03.191 --> 02:38:06.027
You thought you could keep
your family safe, but you can't.

02:38:08.405 --> 02:38:10.115
Only one way to keep
them safe.

02:38:13.994 --> 02:38:15.996
So let's get this
over with before

02:38:16.121 --> 02:38:17.038
you lose another kid.

02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:29.926
Get down!

02:39:12.344 --> 02:39:13.428
- Who's down?
- Zdinarsik, you copy?

02:39:13.553 --> 02:39:14.596
Sound off!

02:39:14.763 --> 02:39:15.513
Clear!

02:39:16.806 --> 02:39:18.183
Prager.
You read?

02:39:20.226 --> 02:39:21.227
Eyes up.
Eyes up!

02:39:30.487 --> 02:39:31.488
Move up!

02:39:34.032 --> 02:39:35.033
Push left. Go!

02:39:35.742 --> 02:39:36.910
Push right. Get around on her.

02:39:37.369 --> 02:39:38.244
Who's got eyes?

02:40:23.748 --> 02:40:24.499
MaJake.

02:40:31.172 --> 02:40:32.299
It's Mom!

02:40:38.763 --> 02:40:39.889
That's right.

02:40:40.265 --> 02:40:42.183
They're coming for you.

02:41:33.026 --> 02:41:34.027
Dad! Dad.

02:41:37.405 --> 02:41:38.657
Okay.
Where's your sister?

02:41:38.782 --> 02:41:39.449
Where is she?
Where is she?

02:41:39.616 --> 02:41:41.076
That way.
That way.

02:41:41.534 --> 02:41:42.535
Okay, stay behind me.

02:41:47.832 --> 02:41:48.792
Kiri!

02:41:50.043 --> 02:41:51.544
Runnin' out of time here, Corporal.

02:41:53.338 --> 02:41:56.299
You already lost one kid today.
You really wanna lose another?

02:41:57.175 --> 02:41:58.510
Do not test me!

02:42:00.303 --> 02:42:01.763
Just kill him, Dad!

02:42:04.599 --> 02:42:05.600
Weapons down.

02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:06.309
Don't.

02:42:06.434 --> 02:42:07.060
Don't do it.

02:42:07.060 --> 02:42:07.978
Down!

02:42:10.397 --> 02:42:11.398
Kick 'em away.

02:42:13.608 --> 02:42:14.276
Do it!

02:42:17.445 --> 02:42:18.488
No.

02:42:20.323 --> 02:42:21.324
Cuff yourself.

02:42:21.491 --> 02:42:22.909
No! No, don't
hurt her, okay?

02:42:23.076 --> 02:42:24.077
Stand there!

02:42:24.911 --> 02:42:26.496
- Don't!
- Don't move!

02:42:26.496 --> 02:42:27.455
Not a step.

02:42:28.248 --> 02:42:29.958
Cuffs on. Now.

02:42:30.166 --> 02:42:32.210
You son
of a bitch.

02:42:32.377 --> 02:42:33.878
Please, don't
hurt her.

02:42:37.090 --> 02:42:38.300
Release.

02:42:39.259 --> 02:42:40.260
Or I cut.

02:42:42.846 --> 02:42:44.973
What, you think I
care about some kid?

02:42:46.308 --> 02:42:47.309
He's not mine.

02:42:48.143 --> 02:42:49.936
We're not even the same species.

02:42:50.729 --> 02:42:52.230
Just please don't...

02:42:52.355 --> 02:42:53.106
don't hurt her.

02:42:53.273 --> 02:42:54.774
Just please
let her go.

02:42:54.941 --> 02:42:55.942
- Don't.
- Please!

02:42:56.109 --> 02:42:56.735
Don't kill him.

02:42:56.860 --> 02:42:57.652
Listen to me!

02:42:57.819 --> 02:42:59.279
Let her go. Don't hurt her.

02:42:59.487 --> 02:43:00.947
Mom, don't kill him.

02:43:01.698 --> 02:43:03.992
A son for a son.

02:43:06.202 --> 02:43:07.454
Please don't hurt her.

02:43:09.789 --> 02:43:10.999
I cut.

02:43:11.166 --> 02:43:12.417
Please just let her go...

02:43:12.417 --> 02:43:13.126
okay?

02:43:13.126 --> 02:43:13.919
Just let her go.

02:43:16.129 --> 02:43:16.963
No!

02:43:26.264 --> 02:43:28.516
Kiri... Kiri.

02:43:35.357 --> 02:43:36.358
Spider.

02:43:37.233 --> 02:43:37.859
Spider...

02:43:37.984 --> 02:43:39.069
get 'em out of here.

02:43:39.527 --> 02:43:40.153
Come on.

02:43:40.654 --> 02:43:41.529
Guys. Tuk.

02:43:41.655 --> 02:43:43.448
I owe you
a death.

02:43:45.075 --> 02:43:45.700
Mom.

02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:46.701
- Mama.
- Come.

02:43:46.868 --> 02:43:47.827
Come on.

02:43:47.827 --> 02:43:48.703
Please...

02:43:48.828 --> 02:43:49.454
Mama.

02:43:49.955 --> 02:43:51.456
You're not leaving,
are you, Jake?

02:43:52.248 --> 02:43:53.249
Knowin'
I'm out there.

02:43:54.501 --> 02:43:56.586
Knowin' that
I'll never stop.

02:43:56.962 --> 02:43:58.255
I'm coming for you.

02:43:58.421 --> 02:44:01.132
And when I do, I'll
kill your whole family.

02:44:02.175 --> 02:44:03.093
Dad...

02:44:05.303 --> 02:44:06.221
Then let's get it done.

02:44:16.982 --> 02:44:17.983
Jake!

02:44:22.279 --> 02:44:23.363
- It's coming!
- Back. Back.

02:44:23.530 --> 02:44:24.739
Get back to the ship. Go!

02:44:24.906 --> 02:44:25.907
Tuk, swim, swim.

02:44:29.077 --> 02:44:30.036
Stay close.

02:44:30.287 --> 02:44:31.288
- Keep moving.
- Stay close.

02:44:33.915 --> 02:44:34.541
Tuk!

02:44:35.875 --> 02:44:36.751
Mom, take
my hand!

02:44:36.876 --> 02:44:37.544
Hold on!

02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:41.965
Mom!

02:44:43.633 --> 02:44:44.509
- Kiri, come on.
- No...

02:44:44.676 --> 02:44:45.552
Kiri, we've got
to go, come on.

02:44:45.677 --> 02:44:46.303
No!

02:44:49.556 --> 02:44:51.016
Go! Climb.
Climb!

02:44:51.474 --> 02:44:52.475
Kiri,
come on!

02:44:53.643 --> 02:44:54.686
Come on,
let's go!

02:44:55.437 --> 02:44:56.062
Mom!

02:44:56.187 --> 02:44:56.896
Swim! Swim.

02:44:57.272 --> 02:44:57.939
Go, Tuk.

02:44:58.064 --> 02:44:58.690
Climb up.

02:45:06.406 --> 02:45:07.073
Mom...

02:45:08.199 --> 02:45:09.200
Go!

02:45:09.743 --> 02:45:10.744
Go, go, go!

02:45:18.209 --> 02:45:19.377
Keep climbing!
Go!

02:45:23.924 --> 02:45:24.925
I got you.

02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:28.094
Give me your hand!

02:45:28.219 --> 02:45:28.887
Come on!

02:45:31.514 --> 02:45:32.307
Open it!

02:45:40.982 --> 02:45:41.608
Open it!

02:45:41.608 --> 02:45:42.317
Move back.

02:45:42.317 --> 02:45:43.026
Move back.

02:45:43.735 --> 02:45:44.736
Come.

02:45:46.237 --> 02:45:46.947
Tuk!

02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:57.958
Climb!

02:45:58.249 --> 02:45:59.209
Go!

02:46:01.461 --> 02:46:02.170
Climb!

02:46:02.545 --> 02:46:03.171
Go!

02:46:04.005 --> 02:46:04.798
Go up!

02:46:10.595 --> 02:46:11.596
We're
rolling over!

02:46:11.972 --> 02:46:12.597
Go, go,
go, go!

02:46:12.597 --> 02:46:13.431
Okay...

02:46:15.976 --> 02:46:17.060
No!

02:46:17.519 --> 02:46:18.645
Mom!

02:46:26.778 --> 02:46:27.779
Kiri!

02:46:27.904 --> 02:46:28.613
Keep going!

02:46:32.325 --> 02:46:33.326
This way,
this way!

02:46:33.827 --> 02:46:34.494
Okay.

02:46:34.661 --> 02:46:35.287
Go!

02:46:39.416 --> 02:46:41.418
Open it!
Open it!

02:46:43.378 --> 02:46:44.462
Mom!

02:46:47.507 --> 02:46:48.508
Come on!

02:46:58.059 --> 02:46:59.060
Go, Tuk!

02:47:01.146 --> 02:47:02.147
There's no way out!

02:47:04.441 --> 02:47:05.525
Stay together, okay?

02:47:05.692 --> 02:47:07.068
- Yes.
- Stay together.

02:47:07.235 --> 02:47:08.236
Yes.

02:47:37.182 --> 02:47:38.391
Oh, Great
Mother!

02:47:38.516 --> 02:47:39.893
Oh, Great
Mother, help us!

02:48:22.727 --> 02:48:23.728
Kiri!

02:48:44.291 --> 02:48:44.916
Bro!

02:48:45.875 --> 02:48:46.793
Mom and Dad...

02:48:46.918 --> 02:48:47.627
are down there.

02:48:47.752 --> 02:48:48.378
In the ship.

02:48:48.545 --> 02:48:49.588
Grab on.

02:48:50.380 --> 02:48:51.381
Bro, I'm
good. Go!

02:49:19.117 --> 02:49:20.118
Okay.

02:49:47.938 --> 02:49:48.939
Jake!

02:50:25.684 --> 02:50:26.351
Dad.

02:50:31.523 --> 02:50:32.524
Fuck!

02:50:47.289 --> 02:50:49.040
Come on, you son of a bitch!

02:50:49.249 --> 02:50:50.166
Dad, just breathe.

02:50:50.375 --> 02:50:51.209
Neteyam?

02:50:52.002 --> 02:50:53.003
No, Dad.
It's Lo'ak.

02:50:54.421 --> 02:50:55.422
Oh, Lo'ak.

02:50:56.715 --> 02:50:57.716
I'm sorry, sir.

02:50:58.216 --> 02:50:59.926
I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

02:51:00.135 --> 02:51:01.136
Just focus.

02:51:01.261 --> 02:51:02.345
Focus on now.

02:51:21.615 --> 02:51:22.741
We're losing
the air pocket.

02:51:22.907 --> 02:51:23.908
Come on.
We've gotta move.

02:51:24.075 --> 02:51:25.160
Come on, Dad.

02:51:32.876 --> 02:51:34.419
You know your way out?

02:51:34.836 --> 02:51:37.547
I think so. But, Dad,
it's gonna be a long breath-hold.

02:51:37.714 --> 02:51:39.257
I can't make it.

02:51:39.799 --> 02:51:41.176
You can. You can.

02:51:41.301 --> 02:51:41.927
No.

02:51:42.052 --> 02:51:43.094
So you gotta go right now.

02:51:43.595 --> 02:51:45.138
I can't lose you
too, Dad.

02:51:45.305 --> 02:51:45.972
Please.

02:51:50.477 --> 02:51:52.062
Mama,
I'm scared.

02:51:53.563 --> 02:51:54.564
It is all right.

02:51:55.398 --> 02:51:56.441
Stay close to me.

02:51:57.400 --> 02:51:58.443
Stay close to Mama.

02:52:01.029 --> 02:52:02.030
It's okay.

02:52:18.713 --> 02:52:20.548
You just have to
slow your heart down.

02:52:21.007 --> 02:52:22.175
Be real calm.

02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:24.761
Breathe
from here.

02:52:24.928 --> 02:52:26.513
Hey, breathe from here.

02:52:40.068 --> 02:52:41.403
The way of water has no...

02:52:41.528 --> 02:52:42.821
beginning and no end.

02:52:45.532 --> 02:52:47.575
The sea is around
you and in you.

02:52:49.202 --> 02:52:50.412
The sea is your home...

02:52:50.537 --> 02:52:52.872
before your birth
and after your death.

02:52:58.086 --> 02:53:00.964
The sea gives
and the sea takes.

02:53:02.215 --> 02:53:04.259
Water connects
all things.

02:53:06.428 --> 02:53:07.971
Life to death.

02:53:09.806 --> 02:53:12.100
Darkness to light.

02:53:35.373 --> 02:53:36.207
- Hi.
- Kiri!

02:53:36.374 --> 02:53:37.334
Kiri.

02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:39.502
Everything's going to
be all right, little sister.

02:53:39.836 --> 02:53:40.670
Mom...

02:53:40.795 --> 02:53:42.172
I'm gonna
give this to you.

02:53:47.218 --> 02:53:48.094
It'll help you.

02:53:49.679 --> 02:53:50.639
Dad, you can do this.

02:53:52.474 --> 02:53:53.683
Trust me.

02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:55.268
Calm your heart.

02:53:57.646 --> 02:53:58.647
Big breaths.

02:54:02.651 --> 02:54:03.652
Last breath.

02:54:08.698 --> 02:54:09.699
Follow me.

02:55:26.026 --> 02:55:27.277
Hold on.

02:55:27.402 --> 02:55:28.320
Just breathe.

02:55:28.987 --> 02:55:29.821
Just breathe.

02:55:34.409 --> 02:55:35.410
Thank you.

02:55:44.419 --> 02:55:45.921
I See you...

02:55:46.087 --> 02:55:46.880
son.

02:55:49.549 --> 02:55:50.383
MaJake!

02:55:51.801 --> 02:55:52.928
- Dad!
- Mom!

02:55:53.094 --> 02:55:54.304
Dad. Dad.

02:55:55.805 --> 02:55:56.473
Come on.

02:55:59.017 --> 02:56:00.185
Here.

02:56:06.524 --> 02:56:07.525
Brother.

02:56:16.952 --> 02:56:18.870
Sullys stick together.

02:56:21.206 --> 02:56:22.749
It was our
greatest weakness...

02:56:24.125 --> 02:56:25.585
and our
great strength.

02:56:27.587 --> 02:56:29.339
Thank you, Great Mother.

02:56:30.048 --> 02:56:31.049
Thank you.

02:57:10.380 --> 02:57:11.381
Let's move out.

02:57:18.013 --> 02:57:19.014
Son.

02:57:21.266 --> 02:57:22.267
Come with me.

02:57:27.022 --> 02:57:28.023
Spider!

02:58:02.349 --> 02:58:03.266
Monkey Boy!

02:58:07.938 --> 02:58:09.147
Spider.

02:58:16.488 --> 02:58:17.656
- You all right?
- Yeah.

02:58:21.868 --> 02:58:22.869
Come here.

02:58:25.872 --> 02:58:28.041
A son for a son.

02:58:44.808 --> 02:58:47.060
Every songcord must have a last bead.

02:59:12.252 --> 02:59:14.087
A father protects.

02:59:15.422 --> 02:59:16.923
It's what gives him meaning.

02:59:45.285 --> 02:59:47.746
The People say that
all energy is only borrowed.

02:59:50.582 --> 02:59:52.459
And one day you
have to give it back.

03:00:06.306 --> 03:00:07.974
Eywa holds...

03:00:08.183 --> 03:00:09.601
all her children in her heart.

03:00:11.561 --> 03:00:12.854
Nothing is ever lost.

03:00:16.191 --> 03:00:17.192
Neteyam!

03:00:17.817 --> 03:00:19.027
Neteyam!

03:00:39.089 --> 03:00:40.340
My family and I...

03:00:41.466 --> 03:00:42.509
we'll move on tomorrow.

03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:44.386
Far away from here.

03:00:45.804 --> 03:00:47.514
Your son lies
with our ancestors.

03:00:48.807 --> 03:00:51.476
You are
Metkayina now.

03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:58.608
And there it was.

03:01:00.610 --> 03:01:02.028
We are Sea People now.

03:01:04.572 --> 03:01:06.491
This is our home.

03:02:07.052 --> 03:02:08.053
Dad!

03:02:08.929 --> 03:02:09.930
Look what
I caught!

03:02:10.722 --> 03:02:11.723
Wow.

03:02:13.016 --> 03:02:14.059
Oh, that's a big one.

03:02:14.726 --> 03:02:16.394
He was in that pool.

03:02:16.519 --> 03:02:17.145
By the rocks.

03:02:19.356 --> 03:02:20.607
Right where
you said.

03:02:24.486 --> 03:02:25.612
What is it, Dad?

03:02:27.155 --> 03:02:28.156
Why are
you crying?

03:02:30.450 --> 03:02:33.036
I'm just happy
to see you, boy.

03:02:34.663 --> 03:02:35.997
I'm happy to
see you, too.

03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:39.376
Here.

03:02:39.501 --> 03:02:40.252
You try.

03:02:42.754 --> 03:02:43.755
Okay.

03:02:45.507 --> 03:02:46.841
Leave any for me?

03:02:47.008 --> 03:02:48.009
Maybe.

03:02:54.683 --> 03:02:56.434
Yeah! Check that out. See?

03:03:04.067 --> 03:03:05.360
I see now.

03:03:06.319 --> 03:03:08.321
I can't save my
family by running.

03:03:09.489 --> 03:03:10.532
This is
our home.

03:03:11.533 --> 03:03:13.118
This is
our fortress.

03:03:14.494 --> 03:03:16.579
This is where we
make our stand.
